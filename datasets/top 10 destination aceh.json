The subject is superbly presented and for sure you'll be touched on how the local protected their lovely land from being colonized. Such a fighter!! Even my 9 years daughter are interested with the story explained by our guide Mr. Safriyal...Unlucky when my phone battery are out so the picture are so limited. And the only thing we can do is to ask help from our superb guide to take our phote using his handphone.. hehehe.. Tq bro...", "The Rumah Aceh (traditional house) was interesting, and it worth climbing upstairs to see the pictures of Aceh's heroes along the walls. Inside the museum, there are so many interesting objects to be learnt. The museum is a must-visit, and don't forget to pose in front of the house.", "Nice museum with traditional Aceh house model. You will gain knowledge in this museum about Aceh, many exhibiting antiques from the trading period and the Aceh tradition. The museum is open from morning but at lunch hour it will close and open again after that.", "This museum is quite informative if you want to learn about Aceh history and culture. When I went to this place, there was no guide so what I could do was walk around the museum and only read the information available.", "Overall , nothing much , but at least give it a visit , you need to pay for entrance fee R20'000 . that i think is ok , but as i visit all the places in aceh , all are no entrance fee ,", "The museum itself is not realy nice. the subject is not superbly presented. BUT: it is such an emotional visit. watchig movies, fotos, interviews of the time before, while and after the tusnami takes place throws you on an emotional ride. It is worth the visit. remembering such a terrible event and understand, that only because of the Tsunami there is peace in Aceh. peace no one thought was possible in 2004", "When in Banda Aceh, this is a must place to visit. It has many archeological artifacts and other exhibits which is worth one's visit. The only let down is there are no staffs in attendance, that if you have questions there is no one to attend to you. There is also a gallery on Melaka donated by the state government of Melaka in Malaysia but at the time of our visit it was closed.", "Beautifully preserved house and the staff that are working at the museum was very patient in telling us the stories of the Acehnese history.", "Do not expect an extensive content.

It was a major, devastating event that killed 1 in 5 people here, ended a long-simmering war, and shaped the life of this town. Sadly, the museum was poorly designed to begin with and has been left to fall apart in a mere 15 years. There's no timeline of the day of the earthquake and no model of the area affected showing the epicenter, and how the waves hit land around the Indian Ocean basin. Perhaps originally this kind of critical information was conveyed by one of the broken computer monitors that supposedly hosted an interactive display at one time. But, sadly, all of these are broken now. Other than a short movie with original footage from people's phones and a few photos, there's very little here to bring the event to life and explain it. Most rooms are empty or have these broken interactive displays.", "The museum is not really worth visiting - a visit to the ship PLTD Apung 1 is much more informative.", "The building is very beautiful , tall and artistic. It seems good from outside. But inside, I think there are still many space or room for display something there. A big building with a little display there. So wasting space", "Disappointed as just tried to go to the museum but it's closed on a Monday....only in Aceh for the day so will miss it this trip unfortunately. I did get a driver to take me to the tanker ship that the tsunami dumped 5km from the sea though..... This ship is huge and gives you an insite into just how powerful the tsunami was and the devistation it caused. Some of the pictures in the gallery there ate a little disturbing and bought a fre tears. I also managed to see the boat on a house roof. Banda Aceh have recovered well from such an awful ordeal but good to see they are remembering in some ways too. As a final point the people in Banda Aceh are so happy, warm", "The entrance is free because it is the month of remembering Tsunami. The building design is impressive and the entrance ambience is a highlight. Next, you can see the list of Tsunami victims and also visual during the tsunami.", "When you enter the museum, you walk through a dark hall with water coming down the walls. Aceh has lost so many people to the tsunami, and this is displayed through a wall full of names. This was impressive to see. The rest of the museum is disappointing: often no text or only text in Bahasa was provided; very big rooms are filled only with limited images. We only needed 30 minutes to walk through it, and that was already long compared to the exhibition available.", "I went there with my office colleagues. they charge ticket 3.000 for local people and 10.000 for foreigner. the current condition of the museum is devastating. Rooms are empty, exhibition walls are placed untidy. walls are losing colours. And mostly annoying is they don\u2019t show the only interesting material like the 30minutes video in the time between 12-2PM. it was waste of time.", "This museum was very enlightening. There\u2019s English and Indonesian language available. The story is heartbreaking and really makes you stop and think. The layout is quite brilliant and the models of the land give a unique perspective. The admission price for foreigners is 10,000idr. Worth a visit but expect to walk away eyed.", "This museum is very unique. Built as memorial of tsunamy 2004 that claimed the lives of thousands people from some countries. Is has great architecture with some details of the tragedy and this museum is telloing stories.", "Specially build to commemorate the tsunami desaster and with a special architecture to dramatize the desaster. I think the museum gives an excellent impression of the desaster", "If you're going to Pulau Weh, I suggezt you give the pleasant town of Banda Aceh half a day at least to look round. Alongside an incredible mosque in the centre of the town, and easy walking distance from it, is the Tsumami museum. Free entrance. Its a very modern building and the designers have triec to bring alive the terrible devastation it had on this area of Aceh. One circular room that had a woman singing to the many thousands of dead, the names of which were written in line after line on the wall, actally made me begin to cry it was that affecting. I recommend a visit if you want an insight into the loss many still deal with every day in the surrounding area.", "On arriving at the rather impressive looking building I got myself ready for a good learning session. It wasnt long before I realised that this was going to be a let down. Turned out to be a major let down. Exhibits embarrassingly pitiful. Missing translations. When I left the biggest question on my mind was where did all the money go that was donated to build it. What a wasted opportunity to educate on such a horrific event.i will never return.", "The tsunami museum imposes with its wonderful architecture - and that's about it. The most impressive part is the beginning where one walks through a narrow wall with water and the roaring sound of the tsunami. The rest of the museum is sadly a bit run down, the 3rd floor was closed and it has no structure and does not live up to the importance of the event and its remembrance. Sadly a bit of a disappointing experience.", "best thing about this museum is the zero rupiah entrance fee.", "This place is a reminder to humanity and my kids learned about survival skills, geology and creation of the Universe.", "it's beautiful building.", "Very run down. Displays were not working. After 5 minutes we were told to leave because they were closing for prayer. Extremely disappointing experience.", "It was a noble idea to set up the Tsunami Museum but many areas need upgrading or cleaning or just some TLC", "Good in term of information. Experience wise, lot can be improved. Some rooms were empty. It will be more interesting if there are staffs in every room for a live commentator. I found the commentator at masjids that involved in the disaster in 2004 done a lot more for a meaningful visit with their live experienced", "here, we can feel the rumbling sound of tsunami water that makes us feel like the victims are suffering from the waves", "This place is a Muzium dedicated for Tsunami that happened in 26 Dec 2014. There are displays and wreckage kept from the disaster.", "Frankly... I am not a museum person. This museum was really an eye opener for me. If you want to know more about the tragedy, this is the place to be. You can have a crash course here. This museum is kids and wheelchair friendly. Love how they put all the information and exhibit into places.", "Quite few exhibits are closed, in need of maintenance. Run down museum in need of investment/refurbishment. It's is extremely important to keep this museum open to remind future generations of the impact this tsunami had to this region not only on personal level but also politicaly.", "This museum not just show to us what really happened on 26th December 2004, but more than that it really tell us the stories that happened on that disaster day and it really motivating.", "Visited this museum just two days ago. Of course a sad history with so much loss of life. There are many aspects to this museum, however they do state that they were aware of the Tsunami's history in Banda Ache but it was forgotten and people had not wanted to be reminded of the dangers. Now people are aware not just in Asia but worldwide, we must remember the people, animals, everything lost due to this tragedy. Museum ? well it should be stated it's not as forceful a reminder than it could be. Tragic, sad & possibly forgotten in the next twenty years or so.", "This building stands out as costing a lot of $$$, what a shame it\u2019s such a disappointment inside, besides the area which gives a sense of dark, wet atmosphere we found the exhibits confusing, non sequential and disappointing. Perhaps the audio visual room was more interesting but the queue was too long!! Shame, recommend the boat tsunami exhibition as much more on point.", "This museum is free for all visitor. Must go to see how tremendous aceh tsunami. Have a lot of picture and diorama of tsunami", "Great place.", "An interesting place to visit. It is a great way to tell their story to the world. Though you can also feel some sadness due to all the lives that were lost but in this place they are also remembered. There is so much we can learn from the past that can help us to be prepared for the future.", "Small museum where one finds descriptive accounts of the 2004 Tsunami and ensuing aid efforts (although this account is partial - singling out only Japan and Turkey as donors is very unfair to the US and European as both public and private donors and aid providers). Some photographs can be shocking to small kids.", "A must do visit if you are in Banda Aceh.", "we visit here as part of Aceh city tour after diving in Weh island. i never thought that this museum is very good. entering the alley entrance will make you feel the atmosphere of the tsunami 13 years ago.. with water drizzle and good sound effect. and then entering \"the well of prayer\" will make you sad. its a circle room with 4000 name of the victim while the sound continuously praying. rest of the museum will tell you the story of the tsunami, education and artefact also documentation. a must visit one while you in aceh", "this is a good museum, great architecture. But there are 2 bad things. First, the pool, so dirty. Second, the documentary movie, okay to watch, but not so good.", "This museum commemorates those victims of Tsunami on 26 Dec 2004. I believe that every tourists visiting Aceh. The disaster was devastating, you can view snapshots of the conditions before and after the disaster. Although not that many things can be seen there, you can feel the sorrow from the thousands of names of people who died on the wall. The museum buildings are unique and beautiful for picture takings.", "We visited Aceh Tsunami Museum during our shot stop over in Banda Aceh and were very glad we did.", "Be sure to watch the documentary video. The museum needs some more English information inside though.", "There is no entry fee and this will make u know the history of the place before and after the great tsumami", "This is our first time visiting Acheh and its museum. Learn a lot of history especially on the tsunami. Thebuilding was design by local and resemble a big ship. very huge museum exhibit the pre and post tsunami event.", "There's not much to do in Banda Aceh and this is the main tourist attraction. There were many moving exhibits of how people lost their homes and loved ones in this natural disaster, and how many different countries pooled resources to help in getting Banda Aceh back on its feet. Our driver didn't enter the compound with us as he said he would get too emotional. Out of 10 family members, only him and his uncle survived in the Tsunami. It really brings things to perspective and not make you sweat the small things in life", "Today we went to visit the Aceh Tsunami Museum, this December 26, 2016 it will be 12 years since the tsunami hit Aceh Province. I was here with my 1st volunteer team from Saddleback church on the 1st week of January 2005, and this is my 32nd trip since, so I have been back a lot. Not sure who the designer was for this museum, but with all the talent Indonesia has, I was quite disappointed in the display and the way it was built, just my opinion. I have been all over the world and have seen the best, from beautiful buildings in Europe (Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam) to USA (the Met, Guggenheim etc.) so with all the money that was given to Aceh, I think it should have been better spent. Many fond memories remain from my 1st days here and I have made many friends through the years. I hope they continue to rebuild and thrive, so well deserved after what they have gone through.", "My first visit to Aceh was in 2005 to assist in humanitarian support just after tsunami struck Aceh. When I visited this Museum recently (Nov 2015) it touched my heart. The devastation I saw 10 years ago in Banda Aceh came back to my mind. This Museum has been built as a multi-purpose building.", "Such a great museum that captures a complete thrilling sensation & feel of a real tsunami that happened in 2004! Stuff you have to see: The entrance tsunami wall in the darkness, the chimney with casualties names, the earthquake house, the solidarity bridge, and the documentary movie. This museum really shows the faith in mankind. simply stunning.", "The museum puts the tsunami into perspective. Its hard to imagine the devastation and loss of life in Banda Aech. Having visited the boat on the house, the generator ship and other monuments to the event the museum put it all into perspective.", "Sad; in very poor condition, although under some degree of renovation. Beautiful architecture, but most exhibits wouldn't work.", "entrance is free - lots of info and photos on tsunami - very good knowledges for myself. during my visit there's a lot of school kids - some are running and making a lot of noises - which the museum may need to look into it but then this may be out of their control as well since these are kids :D", "The architecture is striking with visitors passing thru a dark passageway with mist and rain coming down, making us think what it must have been like. There are also wide open spaces and nuances recalling waves and the ocean as well as Islamic features in accordance with Aceh's religious and cultural identity. Definitely worth a visit. Lots of youth also utilize this space as it is one of the few public spaces in Banda Aceh under a restrictive and dictatorial interpretation of Sharia law.", "The entrance! The entrance!", "Museo...take u inside the fear and the pain of the people who suffer the tsunami wave in 2004...is a must see...a lot of respect for the ache see people...", "Sadness of victims story paralel with museum condition that need more effort to reach good condition back. Dirty pool, scratched wall and uncare people from cleanliness make everything getting worse", "It's dedicated for tsunami disaster in 2004. Inside we could see video of chronology events, several remnants of the disaster (helicopter, motorcycle, etc.), walls enlisted names of victims, diorama, scientific education, and a lot more.", "When at Aceh this museum is one of places of interest to visit. Unfortunately local when visiting this museum are quite noisy and some times you fell like in a market. A lot of labeling in the museum is only available in the local language. Bags are not allowed in the museum. One part of the exhibition is with water, in that are the floor get slippery, chose your shoes accordingly. If you are going to explore Aceh, do visit the museum 1st, like that you will know what survived the tsunami and what was reconstructed. I didn't had time to visit the full museum, I do regret that.", "This is a good site to visit for a touching remembrance of the lives lost and the disaster of the tsunami as well as paying tribute to the kind souls and nations that helped rebuild Banda Aceh. It brings to mind the importance of our humanity in times of desperation and a clear reminder that mankind is and will always be subject to mother nature...", "This is really the best place to see, learn, and feel how the tsunami wipe the entite city to the ground. Not to have sympathy, but more on empathy on humanity side.", "Banda Aceh does not have must to offer western tourists, except the exhibitions relating to the tsunami . It's really worth spending time to visit these exhibitions and in particular this museum. The building and architecture is spectacular , the photos, and audio visual presentations will make you extremely humble , what the people of Banda Aceh and adjoining coasts went thought was terrible. The countries that assisted are also recognised .", "Wonderfull modern architecture that alone is already a must. The walls of water, are very impressing entrance to the museum!", "I'm not into museum when traveling as there are abundance of museums back at my hometown. But this one really pulled me in as if there's something inside. Yes, apart from its nice architecture and well integrated interior design with the whole 'experience' commemorating the tragedy of tsunami, I have to confess that this museum at least, among few that I would describe managed to steal my heart. Just don't miss the video session in their 'mini cinema' as I think this is the highlight of the museum in conveying the whole heartbreaking story of tsunami. There are few not working equipments and maintenance issue, but don't put this very little issue as a tick off point not to visit this museum as more important key point of visiting is to get as close as possible to the spirit of what Aceh is all about today after the tragedy.", "What an amazing place. This is somewhere everyone MUST Visit when in the region. The Museum is a credit to Banda Aceh, and reflects on the scale of the disaster, and helps you understand what it migght have been like. It also looks at the history of Tsunamis in tyhe region. Fascinating.", "A nice place to visit...however it is not very well organised for the exhibits in there...most of the simulation is not really working any more...generally photos in there...you can plan to be there and finished within 1/2 hour!", "The building architecturally is very interestering with its spiral walk way. Found the exhibits and film sobering and provided photos and info re the earthquake and tsunami that we were unaware of. I say it is uplifting because what is now Banda Aceh has been almost been completely rebuilt, and people have got back to their lives without continually dwelling on the past every day. The people of BA are genuinely friendly.", "The collections of the museum is nice. But some are broken and need to be repaired. I love to hang out in the library room, because there are a lot of interesting books to read.", "Amazingly it was a stunning shape of building, adopted a shape of boat and drama of tsunami.", "After being here for 24 hours I felt like that was enough in Banda. The Museum was interesting for an our or so.", "Quite moivng and interesting, but mainly lost of amazing pictures.", "Museum tsunami was build in 2008 to commemorate the tsunami victim in Aceh, in this museum we can see and feel tsunami passage, tower of hope, Tsunami picture room, tsunami mock-up room, 4D tsunami movie theatre, tsunami literature in library and so on. All of those is free....", "The wave design of the museum is striking and as you enter through the dark tunnel you get a sense of the magnitude and terror of the tragic event, and I liked the memorial chamber with people\u2019s names and prayers being sung, I found it very moving.", "The information in the museum was very, very poor. Plus, they blame the tsunami on divine powers... instead of understanding that you can predict", "At this place, we can see and learn about history of Aceh, what happen on 26th Dec 2004. A story, silent witness, country that give hand. Very sad, feel thankful too.", "Museum building with great architechture. All there is to know about the devastated 2004 tsunami. Lots of information about the sad events. Though there could be more info on the science of what causes a tsunami but overall its a good museum.", "Not only it need to be refurbish and need maintenance as many places were missing lighting and had very poor AV. But only half of it was accessible, only a few photos, missing glass on modelling. Not much to see, no videos or deeper explanations. And most of things are following apart. Disappointing", "This museum open at 9 am in the morning. The entry fee cost three thousand rupiah. But unfortunately seem dark n humid. The pool full of moss...", "Was OK to visit again with new friends but the layout is odd and its limited on content. As nothing much in town its worth the punt if you stay a few hours.", "This building is very well design, not so crowded, have a lot of movie, picture to describe how the tsunami happening", "The Aceh Tsunami Museum, located in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, is a museum designed as a symbolic reminder of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami disaster, as well as an educational center and an emergency disaster shelter in case the area is ever hit by a tsunami again.", "A tunnel in this museum with sound of chanting al-quran that can make you feel to the morning of the tragedy.

Even if you only vaguely remember how the Tsunami ravaged the people back then, in here you could refresh your memory and witness one of the most horrific experience in modern era again. The free admission makes it the place you must go when you are in Banda Aceh, particularly if you want to know how Banda Aceh has changed since then and pay your tributes to the deceased.", "A remembrance of the 2004 tsunami. The buildings are well designed with the tsunami concepts. There were a short movies about the 2004 tsunami.", "I visited this museum twice within the same week, giving me the opportunity to spend time absorbing all the information and appreciate what the Acehnese people went through and what they have achieved since then. Entry is free because they want everybody to be able to learn about risk reduction and also to acknowledge the assistance provided by international agencies in the rebuilding effort and in the creation of the museum.", "Free of admission but I would gladly pay an admission fee to support the maintenance of the building. The modern architecture has captured the concept totally and the rooms convey an important message. The 'Wishing Well'room is impressive and deeply felt.", "It is a tragedy in a blunt way, as a quarter of humans lost their life in a devastating earthquake and a horrible aftermath \u201cthe tsunami\u201d in Aceh. Life is precious and yet fragile. This message is conveyed in the museum that hosts memories to the disasterous day, on December 26, 2004.

It is a place that I reluctantly visit ...", "Aceh Tsunami Museum is a museum dedicated in rememberance of tsunami which hit Aceh in 2004. There are several sections in the museum depicting situations during and after tsunami.", "Museum closes at 4pm, we did not get there in time to see all of it, but the dioramas we were able to see were impressive and conveyed the scale of destruction. the structure of the museum itself is also interesting in that it was built as a tsunami \"bunker\" to offer shelter in case of a tsunami in the future.

The museum itself could definitely be better though - better organised and more professionally displayed information. But of course you still get the idea of the huge devastation. It's a very moving experience.", "We loved the architecture of the museum that was thoughtfully designed based on the tsunami tragedy.

I could not imagine what it was really like when it happened.", "The whole subject could have been presented a lot better", "The building is an appropriate piece of architecture which gives you a thought provoking experience.

The entrance is free.", "It took us this long to visit Banda Aceh for the first time after Tsunami 2004. A friend recommended a freelance tour guide in Banda Aceh (Muhid, +6285261463396) to take us to places where tsunami left its traces. There was no entrance fee when we queued for tickets at the Tsunami Museum. They issued tickets to track the number of visitors (locals vs international). At the entrance, there was a signboard, warning visitors to skip the low-lit corridor if they have health issues. We took the low-lit corridor. The sound of wind and water splashing felt eerie. We arrived at the chamber of blessing where all the names who perished during the tsunami tragedy are written all around the conical wall structure. We left the chamber and headed towards a hall with many monitors playing a video of the tragic day.

Second site is the video, picture and some document related to the tsunami victims, the damage and personal experience by the victims. Then u walk into dark room full of the 200,000 victims during the tragedy. Here, definitely you'll be touched when seeing too much name on the wall of the dark room. After that, once again u have to walk thru dark tunnel which symbolize the darkness, the pain and the sadness that the victims have to go through their losses. About 4minutes walk, then you'll see a little light at the end of the tunnel. The light become more clear when you approach near to the tunnel end and there you'll wall through a bridge which decorated with a lot of flags from all over the world which symbolize to helps given to the tsunami victims.

Drop by at this museum if you're a first timer in Aceh. It's summarized the disaster starting from the museum entrance till the end. There's victims name on the wall in one of the rooms in the museum, it's quite eery but I was overwhelmed with the whole experience. My advice :- take time/slow down while strolling down the museum, every corner/path has significant design (narrow/dark/echoing pathways) this is to indicate & resemblance the day of the disaster happened. It's like a time machine to take you back to that moment (24 December 2004)", "some kind of sumarize about the tsunami in aceh,they put lots of the victims name of tsunami in a wall, interesting place to visit", "The elegantly-designed museum gives one a sense of solemness as well as an air of sadness in reflection of a great tragedy that befell so many innocent people.

Interesting architecture is worth a look alone. I found myself tearing up while I watched video of survivors telling their stories. The geological room gives great explanations of earthquakes and tsunamis. Many great exhibits but yet many that weren't functional. It's a shame so many weren't working. There's no admission fee but perhaps there should be to better maintain the displays. Go during the heat of the afternoon as most of the building is air conditioned.", "Visiting the Tsunami Museum was an emotional visit. As you enter the museum, you can see water seeping through wall and hear noises as if trying to re-create the experience. Once inside there are lots of tablets where you can browse through the pictures of the Tsunami and also see objects collected after the tsunami. We saw a shell of a helicopter, motorbike and people's personal belonging. There is a video presentation in the theater that shows the aftermath of the disaster. Half of the population of Banda Aceh were wiped out in the Tsunami of Dec 2005. Considering the damage that was done to the city, the people of Banda Aceh have made an excellent recovery and re-build their city with help from foreign donors. It was a very emotional experience for me.", "It's one of the full memorial places at Banda aceh,especially for tsunami tragedy.

Nevertheless we learned alot about that horrible day and this is still a must stop in Banda Aceh.", "Title pretty much sums it up.

The pictures on the screens are really blurred, the video is not great, all of the exhibitions on how a tsunami works, were broken or just didn't do anything so a little let down. I understand money went into the museum to show people the devastation of such a horrible event but maybe that money could of gone to the people of aceh! Maybe watch a video online and then speak to a local and you will get a better understanding of it. Saying that some of the pictures on display are very powerful and really show the distraction caused and the aid that came.", "Truly a magnificent building.

The exhibitions of photos, paintings, replicas etc could pull your heartstring. I distinctively remember a painting of a mother holding her dead baby, a victim of tsunami and my tears flowed.

It teaches us human compassion and that tragedy can hit anyone and anywhere. May Allah prevents other catastrophy to this beautiful country.", "The entrance is probably the highlight of this place.

For starters by displaying all in English next to bahasa.", "a free museum that captures the tsunami devastation in photos, art, exhibition and visuals all to remember.", "The museum is worth visiting as a testament to human resilience and survival.

Nothing really interesting. It was free. It is located in the city centre where is so easy to go. So I thought why didn't I go and kill time.

Some donations will be asked when you collect your bags.", "Some of the features are very impressive and look amazing (for example the entrance and some of the architecture that is supposed to give you a certain feel).

This is where Indonesia sat at the knee of Islamic scholars. All over Aceh you can see different architectural traditions embodied in their Mosques.I lived and worked in Banda Aceh for several years during the recovery period after the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. For the first year I lived in an accommodation which gave me a ringside view just across the street of this Mosque. Its beautiful Minaret is what I saw when I looked out my window. It was from this minaret that the call to prayer would be the first sounds that I would hear each morning. This mosque has become a kind of symbol of survival after the 2004 tsunami. People within the business precinct within which it is located who were able to reach it in time to take sanctuary, survived the wave as it inundated Banda Aceh. The whole site was badly damaged, but the architecture of a mosque offers no serious resistance to destruction of fast flowing water, so its basic scaffolding was able to remain intact. This is how the Acehnese people feel about their religion and this view is embodied in the mosque's survival itself. During the time I was in Banda Aceh, one of our colleagues was married. Part of the ceremony took place at this mosque. I was invited. I was appropriately attired. When I entered the mosque for the ceremony a woman who happened to be there rushed forward and insisted that I leave, forthwith. I was embarrassed and I had to leave. Suddenly I was alienated from this place that had become an important part of my daily life, which had as much a visual presence as much as a sound presence. So, I guess, that non Muslim visitors to Banda Aceh must be prepared to not be allowed to enter this mosque. This does not detract from its splendour nor its place in the Banda Aceh cityscape in any way, but just be prepared to not be allowed to enter. I see from another post that this mosque was designed by a non Muslim. The same is true for the Minaret, at least, of the Grand Mosque in Jakarta, which was designed by a Christian. After all Christians and Muslims, together with members of the Jewish faith, are all of the Abrahamic tradition and already understand quite a lot about each others world view. When I visited Banda Aceh earlier this year there was this beautiful mosque again in all its splendor, with all of the business of daily life continuing around its domain.", "During a business trip I had the opportunity visit this magnificent mosque in Banda Aceh / North Sumatra. Naturally in Aceh I could not enter the mosque itself as I am not a Muslim, however, one can freely wander the magnificent gardens and enjoy the beauty of the bright white mosque with its black tops, beautiful calligraphy, and the tranquility and sanctity of the place in the midst of an otherwise bustling Indonesian city.", "I visited this beautiful mosque because it had been my dream for years.", "I visited this attraction several times when I was working in Banda Aceh.

It is already beautiful from far away, and you can walking around the park around the mosque and take picture if not praying inside.

The staff were very helpful and very welcoming. The restaurant was also fantastic, such beautiful views, a huge selection of food of different cuisine and reasonably priced. There was an issue with hot water in our original villa bathroom but the staff immediately came out to investigate the matter, and when the issue couldn't be resolved within the time of our stay (due to parts not being available), they offered another (even more beautiful) villa for us to move to! Overall, we highly recommend Freddies Sabang; it's definitely a place we would return to.", "After a long journey from Paris via Jakarta and Banda Aceh we arrived on our paradise Island for a few days of RnR before backpacking down Sumatra. We were not disappointed in the slightest. Perfect views, amazing white sanded beach & turquoise waters. Excellent hospitality, a great mix of Indonesian & western food for all the family. Breakfast hit the spot & smoothies to die for! The staff organised a TukTuk tour for us, dolphin watching & snorkelling in the coral reef - which were all incredible. Our laundry came back immaculate and they even arranged a driver & minibus for our onward journey back on the mainland. Absolutely nothing to fault, except maybe we should have stayed longer!", "We had a nice stay at Freddies, everyone was welcoming and the beach was just a dream. Rooms have very thin walls and bathroom could use a renovation or major cleaning. But for that price we cannot complain! Since the island is very small, there is not much to do or explore, so 6 days were a bit too long, even though freddies offers plenty of things to do.", "I have been a regular guest at Freddies for quite many years and always loved to come back to that special place and always admired Freddie*s passion and dedication to that small paradise on earth. Now everything is now changed. Freddie has left Freddies (!!) and together with him the special environment, atmosphere, service, quality, delicious food, peace etc. have also left the place. Besides that many, more rooms and bungalows have been built so now much more people there and consequently much more rush and noise. I'm fully aware that the pandemic has been a huge challenge also for Freddies with nearly no international guests for about two years so of course also Freddies needed to adapt to the new situation where only local guests. However, I just do not understand why that also has led to reduced quality, service and cleaning. At \"old Freddies\" the gourmet dinner was something that contributed to the very special Freddies atmosphere, because before, during and after the fantastic dinner guests got a chance to exchange experiences and recommendations for actives on the island etc. Often nearly like one big family. Now just ala carte menu (at a rather low quality) is served. Also no more buffet breakfast. But again, if no guests for that anymore I fully understand it have been dropped - but just disappointing for the international guests (especially when they expect that). I think it would be fair if Freddies on the web page openly informed that Freddie has left and now new (probably Chinese) owners have taken over. This in order not do disappoint any guests that have been there before and set their expectations based on earlier (great) experiences. However, the beautiful sea and beach is still there and (so far) no bungalows have been built there. Overall, it is my sad view that focus has changed from quality, service and special atmosphere to quantity, volume, less service and normal local guesthouse atmosphere. In addition, it is my clear recommendation that if \u201cnew Freddies\u201d again at a time wants to attract international guests many initiatives need to be taken.", "Good housekeeping, very helpful stuff and a good view to the Ocean. Restaurant is not cozy and food is not really good. Moreover many times some food is not available. All the Time of my stay Indonesian Guests with kids are too loud very early in the Morning, that seems to be ok for Freddies. A very close accomodation offers a quite and much better Location with beautiful designed Restaurant, finest cooking and is not much more expensive.", "We stayed in one of the beach view bungalows and the view is absolutely stunning. Lovely room, very comfy, complete with with mini fridge and water dispenser plus good WiFi reception. They are also very accommodating with arranging pick-up from the airport ferry and were able to be very flexible when I got the ferry time wrong! Freddie and his staff go out of their way to make everyone feel at home, always asking you about your day and putting on lovely evening meals with a lovely family atmosphere. We stayed over Christmas and the Christmas eve meal in particular was great! Amazing snorkeling right off the beach and one of the only places you can wear a bikini. Would 100% return.", "You are woken at 4:50am as there is a local mosque directly behind the rooms. You then have to wait until 10am to order breakfast from the menu unless you get the buffet option. The waiters all smoke, often while serving you. Freddie was smoking in the kitchen whilst preparing food. Food got cold whilst the staff had a cigarette. There is no non-smoking area in the whole restaurant. Food is bland and local cuisine was the worst we had during our month in Sumatra. The beach is rocky and the water was murky. There is a public toilet block directly under the restaurant and makes the whole place stink. Music is outdated (Celine Dion and worse) and Freddie needs to be more environmentally conscious - every drink is served with a plastic straw. Eon, the receptionist is the only positive thing in the whole place. Freddie needs to know what tourists expect in 2020.", "Room and resto have a very good view of clear blue water overseeing straight of Malacca.

We are all entitled to our own opinion. But when a reviewer tells blatant lies on a public forum, I feel obliged to put the record straight. It is not true that you pay extra for your snorkelling equipment on the snorkelling trips with Salim's boat contracted by Freddies. It is an all inclusive price. I went on two snorkelling trips with a total of 10 other guests during my stay at Freddies and not a single guest paid for anything extra. Even lunch on Rubiah Island was free. True value for money. If you showed any inclination to learn some more, you would have heard that Salim participates in a variety of coral restoration projects. It is not true that he indiscriminately drop his anchor and destroy coral. He has done these snorkelling", "The service that Freddie and his team offer is probably the best I have received anywhere in the world, and I have travelled extensively. Freddie leads his team with style and grace and the outcome is fantastic for the guests. The little resort is spotless, the location is surreal and the food is world class. There is an ala carte restaurant which is open all day but the nightly buffet is the way to go. For RP65,000 (AUD$6.50) you get entree and starter served at you table and then a beautiful buffet, all freshly prepared by Freddie and then dessert, amazing value.

This is not the typical western run resort you might expect, Freddy not only employs local people, but he offers them great incentives for running well the business and gives back to the community.

He gave a great running commentary from the airport all the way to the jetty about Acheh. As I was travelling alone, it was nice to have Freddie arrange the transportation all the way to his place.On the way back, Ifan picked me up at the jetty and took me around Acheh before my flight out of Acheh.

The room itself was clean, had a mosquito net and a hot shower. The staff was very friendly and helped us arrange logistics to and from the island and also gave good tips for spending our time. We also rented a scooter from the hotel. We really liked the a-la-carte menu for lunch and dinner with nice veggies, noodles, pizzas and fresh juices.

We would suggest to also allow ordering a la carte for breakfast.", "We just returned from a stay at Freddie\u2019s. Firstly, the staff are really wonderful/ super helpful with providing us with vegetarian options and booking transport etc for us. The biggest downfall of this hotel is the pollution that is occurring here from both local and international tourists, this is made worse at the resort still offer plastic rather than reusable straws. This differs from nearby resort Casa Nemo whom already have multiple signs available about littering, and supply metal straws. I believe Freddie mentioned in a previous comment that they do clean the beach every morning, but this is also a small area so plastic from other areas does come into the ocean here.

Got to say that the owner, Freddie is an absolute star, both as a host but also in the kitchen, what he creates every night for the buffet would be fit for any establishment, an absolute joy for foodies, the effort and heart he puts in to making you feel welcome is top class, and really makes your stay memorable.

The people were friendly. The food was great. The ocean was beautiful! I loved the snorkeling. Freddies is what made the trip for us. First, let me state that this is not a high end luxury resort. In fact, I don't think you can find that anywhere in Sabang. But, the value is phenomenal. What you get for what you pay is amazing. The rooms are simple, but clean. The facilities are close together, but have an amazing view. And Freddie does an amazing job with food. You do not want to miss the evening buffet dinner. It is well worth it.

We usually go to different places for dinner when we're on vacation, but we ate at Freddies every evening because it was so good. What makes this place truly special is Freddy himself and his crew.

The rest of our stay was in a single bungalow.

I just loved everything about this place. The room is basic but comfortable and clean.

I highly recommend them, varied 4 course menus served each evening in an informal collective way shared with your other residents. The breakfasts are equally as good and varied. There is limited choice for other places to dine in the location but not a problem as Freddie\u2019s is so good, we ate here every meal time. The location for beach relaxing and snorkelling is fantastic. I recommend catching the morning sunrise, and a snorkel before", "My last time on Pulau Weh I stayed at accommodation down the beach but we were never replayed money they had overcharged us, so this time I chose Freddie\u2019s knowing from experience the food was great. My goodness what a host! Freddie is amazing, the most delightful, endearing ,sincere man and the best host I\u2019ve experienced travelling. We stayed in the deluxe accommodation on the beach, which is not deluxe by Western standards, but comfortable, perfectly situated on the gorgeous beach with a balcony and day bed to chill and read when not snorkelling the abundant bay below. Freddie\u2019s banquets are amazing and delicious. My only criticism of Freddie\u2019s is the service from staff in the a la carte restaurant, they did not approach customers when they sat down at times or take orders and", "The best place to stay in Pulau weh! Great white sand beach, perfect for snorkling. Awesome view from the bungalows, directly on the beach. Very clean and the staff is super friendly. The evening dinner buffet is very special and delicious!", "Stayed here for 5 nights. Freddie was so welcoming and warm and my room was lovely, overlooking the ocean. Warm shower, fridge and kettle provided. Food was definitely a highlight with themed dinners every night as well as a wine and spirits menu. A great spot.", "Freddies offers the best room view, i can spend all day at the balcony.. beautiful sunrise view i can never forget.. the owner and staff are really friendly and i feel so welcomed.. food is great with big portion.. totally worth for money.. thumbs up!", "Thankyou Freddie for our stay at your resort. Freddie and his staff have worked hard for all their guests, especially as it was Ramadan for them. The view that awaits you when you get to the end of the narrow path takes your breath away. You have to be manage steps to stay here. Our room was great I called it posh glamping, a bit like a very well equipped beach Hut. The fans and sea breeze are more adequate. The resort is as close to natural as you can get, with a few luxuries. Freddies breakfast and evening buffets are fabulous. The variety and quantities are stunning. They will help in anyway they can with food requests. If you want a place to relax where time doesn't matter this is a fantastic place. I read 3 books from Freddies library. The scuba trip as well as local", "We stayed at Freddies for 10 days and it was absolutely amazing. The bungalow was clean and cosy and the sea view without words. The staff is very friendly,the bungalow hast been cleaned every day and theres free water,tea and coffee! What else could you want for that reasonable price? Freddie is a lovely host and an amazing cook. He s trying to take care of every single guest and his personal needs. We felt \"at home \" from the first moment wie arrived. For us its definiately THE BEST PLACE TO STAY on this absolutely beautyful island!!!!", "We had a wonderful stay at Freddie's. The dinner buffet is very varied, and Freddie personally talks to every guest during dinner to make sure that all guests get everything they could hope for and more. When we were ill, Freddie immediately opened up his first Aid Kit and gave us pills to get better. Trips or diving courses are arranged perfectly, and when everything in sabang was closed so we couldn't buy a plane ticket on short notice, Freddie once again was a lifesaver! The houses could be cleaner, but they are cosy, have a georgeous vieuw, a hammock and a hot shower which is everything you need. Santai means relaxed, and this is really what you will get thanks to Freddie's understanding and involvement. We stayed at four different hotels and resorts on Pulau Weh, but", "It was a great place to stay, mini- paradise with all that you needed in one place. Freddie is an excellent host, extremely friendly and helpful organized all transport and activities for us. The menu has an excellent range and we loved the food. The buffet dinner at 65000 Rupiah is beyond value for money - an excellent fusion of flavours and changes every day. The team who work with Freddie are very helpful. We loved our accommodation - though basic there is a kettle, constant water, hot shower and fan. Freddie has considered his guests every need. Snorkeling immediately in front of the resort provides you with an array of colourful fish to feast your eyes on. I would highly recommend the snorkeling trip which Freddie can organize for you. A full day going to various sites", "Now, where do i start ? Vacations and seeing new places are some of the things many of us like to do . But vacation is just a vacation if there is no added substance into it . Freddie's will open your mind and soul to appreciate every essence of life we have at our home,which we take for granted almost every aspect of it ...by seeing the locals trying their level best to accommodate the guests .These people are less fortunate than us yet they have a greater smile and bigger sincerity when they ask How Are You , they truly mean it .These people at Freddie's will take care of you like family without expecting a dime from you. It all starts from Freddie , the man with a heart of an angel. He has probably 10 extra people working for him in his resort which he does not need but", "I feel bad when people write bad reviews and not telling the truth. I stayed at Freddies for 4 days with 2 of my friends. We stayed in bungalow 8, the subject of a review a few days ago. Just to set the record straight. The bungalow had a double bed and single bed which was perfect for us. The curtains are not see-through. Standard cotton. There were no smells in the bathroom. The bathrooms are cleaned and disinfected daily. The bed linen was perfect on all the beds and in good condition. The fan was in perfectly working order. Why do you need a blanket if you say the room was hot. Strange. We kept our windows open and also the security door. The room was nice and cool. This place is great value for money, clean and cared for. The staff friendly and supportive. Great food.", "This is exactly the place where you could stay a very, very long time because it is just perfect. Freddies and his team are so great. They offered us a very warm welcome all along the full week we stayed there. We enjoyed the wonderful food served every day, from breakfast to dinner. For daily activities, Freddies helped us to find the right people to go to the right place at the right cost. Strongly recommended in you come to Pulau Weh. Freddies actually deserves his reputation. Thanks very much to him and his team.", "The bungallows are situated on the rock so you can have a fabulous view of the sea directly from your bed. I have fallen in love with the nature around. The bungallows themselves are very simply furnitured. But the view of the balcony is purely breath taking. Do not expect a luxurious place with air-conditioned rooms or a swimming pool, it is not this kind of accommodation. You will enjoy a sandy beach (but there are stones in the entrance to the sea) and an exclusive snorchling area with many species of fish. You will definetely enjoy a family approach and care by Freddie and his team, common \"family like\" dinners with the other guests where you will be introduced to the rest and warmly welcome by Freddie. Everyone then knows everyone. The cuisine is the best on the island.", "Went to Freddie last week for 2 night stay and it was so amazing. Love the beaches, chalet, buffet dinner & breakfast, massage and everything i can say is superb. All the other guest also friendly to each other. Try their Margarita Pizza, delicious!!", "the beach has wonderful view, tho one of my friend experienced sth not good with sea urchins so u guys gotta be careful while swimming in the ocean. Mr Freddy gave us a bigger room without any charge given and also he helped me to bake a simple yet charming and FREE bday cake for my boyfriend. everyone in the restaurant celebrated it with us, he is so beyond happy. thankyou Mr Freddy, ure the best!", "Staying at Freddie's was one of the highlights of our two week trip to Sumatra/Java. Our room was one of the new delux rooms and the balcony had a breath taking view since we were on the beach out over the water. The buffet style breakfast and dinner was outstanding. Freddie would explain each item on the menu before dinner was served which made for great first class treatment. Speaking of such, Freddie went out of his way to help me surprise my boyfriend with a private candle lit dinner on the beach. The quality food, excellent snorkeling, peaceful breezy nights, and massages all made for an excellent start to our romantic getaway vacation.", "My partner and I recently stayed here for 11nights, we had the most amazing time. The rooms were super cleaned with stunning views and comfortable beds. The food was delicious... especially freddies buffet dinners something different every night.. Freddie himself is an amazing person. Will do anything for you. He really does know how to make your trip special and stress free. Such a big heart! His staff are great and so friendly. Amazing snorkeling and private beach. Freddies is definitely a must if you go to sabang. Thanks again Freddie for an amazing holiday! We will be back!", "We stayed at Freddie during the Easter break (Mum, Dad and 2 daughters 13 & 20) we flew from Medan to Sabang airport and Freddie arranged for our pick up. We had a lovely room overlooking the beach and clear blue sea. Food was varied and there was something for everyone. We went on a days snorkelling trip and we were lucky to see a large pod of dolphins before snorkelling. It was a perfect location to switch off and relax. Our return to the main land saw us getting the fast ferry across to Banda aceh where again Freddie arranged for us to have a car & driver for a few hours due to our connecting flight not being till later in the day. Our driver spoke excellent English and took us to the Ache museum, the Tsunami museum, local markets and even to a barbers where my Dad had a", "I got an upgrade room and when i arrived there :) the view was amazing, the room was nice, the foods super delicious and if your solo traveler you will meet cool people there too. Yes, don't be shy just talk! The one thing i always wait was dinner time, Freddie will ask everyone journey and everyone will share it. Seem like a big warm family dinner with amazing foods :)", "I can't say enough good things about Freddie's. My only complaint is that I wasn't able to stay longer. Freddie and his staff are so welcoming and accommodating, the food is delicious, the bungalow is beach-perfect, and they connected me to a guide with whom I had the best snorkeling trip of my life. If sitting in a hammock on your own private balcony and listening to the waves all night isn't your thing...well you're on the wrong island. If it is...then this is the place to stay. No wifi in the room which made work a bit tough, but also made me stop working, and just relax. I will be back...hopefully sooner than later. **Call to prayers is pretty loud in rooms further from the office, but not a problem if you are indeed praying...or able to tune it out.", "I directly like this place much by the time i arrived,the view is amazing just like the post card picture. The balcony room that we got,is nice and comfy.the staff are helpful and the food are great with affordable price. in here u can also bought express boat ticket to sabang and taxi ticket to sabang harbour for only Rp 25k.Overall i will recommended this place to my colleague as A perfect place to loose your bustle...", "We really enjoyed our stay at Mr Freddie's place. Excellent hospitality, delicious food and a very beautiful place. The place is clean and we feel very safe/secured here. Mr Freddie and his staffs took very good care of us from the time we landed in Banda Aceh till we flew back. We were supposed to go on the ferry to Sabang on Thursday but due to bad weather, the ferry couldn't go across so we stayed in Banda Aceh for 2 nights. Mr Freddie sent over Mr Ifan to bring us around Banda Aceh for 2 days. Very excellent driver and very knowledgeable, will recommend him to anyone who wants a tour around Banda Aceh. We're glad because he was our tour guide. Thankfully we were able to make our way to Sabang on Saturday. One of the people we met there said that Sabang stands for", "Freddie and his staff are amazing people, when we came to aceh the ferry just cancelled because of strong wind, Freddie's friend ifan is a very helpful and arrange everything for us. Until we reached sumur tiga,all of our suffering because of heavy waves were gone.It's a beautiful place,nice staff,clean room,and the food also fantastic especially for our lunch, totally finished and clean. If you want anything just let them know, and they will help you. If you want to buy tickets ferry or speedboat, you can buy it from them. Even thou we came in the strong wind and the waves disturbing our journey, it's still unforgettable moments. We will come again.", "I love staying at Freddie's Santai Sumur Tiga. The accommodation is good, the food and the beach is awesome. Very helpful and friendly staff. Exactly like what I wished for. Just me myself, a cozy room with the view of beach in front of me. Bliss. Don't forget to bring your universal charger! (If you are from malaysia)", "The place has a nice sea-view restaurant and their own beautiful white sand beach. You can swim in front of Freddies's place but tides usually very strong. The hotel is simply but you have everything, fan, hot water, balcony with sea-view, shampoo and soap. And..the things I really enjoy in Freddie's, I love their home made breakfast....and the owner's and staff's hospitality. I left my belonging in other place, so I ask someone from Freddie's place to drive me there in early morning. I thought they will charges me or ask some tips, but they didn't. They didn't want any charges. Wow... I never find those things in other place.", "I stayed at Freddie's for two nights in mid December. I found the resort to be very satisfactory. Freddie was an excellent host who was very helpful with providing information and setting up transport from both Banda Aceh city as well as the island. The restaurant served great food. The rooms are decent and worth the money. if you are looking for luxury, this is not the place but be prepared to spend a lot more. the only disappointment was the beach. Although it looked great, there were far too many rocks to make the swimming enjoyable (hence my 4 star rating as opposed to a 5). Its possible that walking farther away may solve that but i did not try as i was heading to the banyak islands anyway. Freddie can arrange transport to Iboh beach where there is great swimming and", "This popular beach hotel is popular for good reason. It is clean, and well maintained. Clearly there is a pride of ownership here that is sadly lacking in many other hotels in Indonesia. Freddie takes a personal interest in where your needs are met. His buffet dinners (planned and prepared by Freddie with help from staff) are well worth it and are fun as they include a fusion of South African recipes mixed in with Indonesian and western cuisine. We were going to stay for two nights, but ended up staying four nights. When we come back to Pulau Weh, we will come back here. Freddies is build on a hill which means every unit has a sea view. it does mean that you need to climb a few stairs. Freddie sends out detailed information about the resort including prices and", "I have stayed at Freddie's twice in the last 7 months - at Christmas and in July. This says it all. I have never before been back to a place - there is too much of the world to discover - but I couldn't resist a return visit to Freddie's! Freddie is the perfect host, from your first email enquiry until departure, ensuring that you get everything you would like out of your stay whether it is rest and relaxation on the beautiful beach, diving with an excellent dive company, a snorkelling trip, motor bike hire or a drive around the island in a becak. Freddie will also arrange your transfer from Banda Aceh or Sabang airports, something I really appreciated as a lone female traveller this time round. Freddie, along with his Indonesian staff, cooks the most amazing 4 course dinner", "Room: Uncle Freddy welcomed us and told us that we were going to be guinea pigs to try their newest family room that can equip up to 6 people. The room is brand new and right in front of the beach, awesome view in the morning but sleep distubance at night because of the waves' noise and some bugs. Remember to bring lemon grass oil to prevent bug bites. Meal: Freddies' Favorite Pizza, Beef Burger & Squid Noodles are our favorites. The breakfast & dinner buffet were so-so, prefer ala carte menus. The view from the cafe is breathtaking. Beach: You can do swimming or snorkeling but remember to rent fin or use non slippery shoes to prevent you from stepping on rocks or poisonous sea animals. Atmosphere: The entrance road to Freddies needs improvement because it is rocky, muddy", "Freddie was super helpful from the first mail I received! It was our first holiday away with a 4 month old in tow and Freddie made sure that it would be a comfortable experience for all of us. The rooms were rustic and old school with tatched roofing and bamboo walls, great for letting in cool breezes and the clear sound of the waves every night. Beds were comfortable, and all three of us got some really good sleep in; but it would of been good to get a pre-warning about the mosques calling! Was a wake up call the first morning, but you get used to it. Didn't even hear it the third morning (was there for 5 days). The absolute highlights of our trip was definitely the dinner and the snorkelling. The snorkelling is very different from Iboih as the waters are deeper and it's", "We stayed here for two nights and enjoined every minute. The tidy clean bungalows in front of the sea with white sandy beach, relaxed atmosphere and most of all Freddie's spirit and the delicious dinners that he cooks personally to his guests every evening. There's no better place here to be spoiled and taken care of in a very fair price.", "My daughter and I stayed her for six nights last month. We had a wonderful time. Freddie could not have been more accomodating. They were full our first night but Freddie found us a room a kilometer away arranged transportation and let us leave our gear at his place. Freddie is a gem of a person who goes the extra mile for his guests (and employees). Our bungalow was very comfortable with a fantastic view of the ocean. Of course the food was spectacular as others have mentioned. Freddie and his staff go to a lot of effort to prepare dinners for the guests, we ate dinner there every evening and were never disappointed. Be aware that the rooms are not air conditioned ( we din't miss it in the least ) and earplugs are a good idea due to the proximity of a nearby mosque and", "Cannot be beaten on price this place. I stayed 9 days and had a lovely quiet relaxing break. I didn't really venture out that much! Didn't need to, as chilled out and read my book or went snorkelling/swimming etc. lazy lazy lazy!!! But on holiday you can do that :))) I've been travelling 3 months south east asia and this is by far the best food I've had. Breakfast is a buffet and was really good - cereals, jams,peanut butter, chocolate spread, lots of fresh fruit, tea/coffee and juice and then a different hot option every day. Very good as most places I stayed you just got 1 option egg!! Now for Dinner - this is where you see the passion from Freddie!! His food. You would see him most of the day in the kitchen and computer area, planning and preparing the dinner. Italian", "Freddies on Sumurtiga is really the Place to be!! Had a great week there over Christmas! Freddie is passionate about cooking- and I really enjoyed his buffet style dinner! He knows how to make guests feel welcome and all his staff are very friendly and helpfull!! Highly recommend this place!!", "Stayed for 1 night at Freddies. It has everything you need! From a nice and clean oceanview room (we love chillin at the hammock in our balcony looking at the ocean), nice food (we had a very nice dinner buffet prepared by Freddie himself), and good location (near Sabang city and the beach shore is fantastic!)", "We really enjoyed our rather short 4 days 3 nights trip stay at Freddie's. Booking was efficient & detailed itinerary/suggestion arrangements by Freddie made our stay lovely. The view from our private bungalow was amazing!! Waves definitely a soothing lullaby. To wind down daily, Freddie's romantic & delicious beach side dinner buffet indeed was the highlight after a full day of snorkeling, sightseeing & lazing around on the hammock reading a book. You can snorkel in front of Freddie's or rent a motorbike to Iboh some 20kms away for a more touristy/ commercialized beach/ dive spot.", "I stayed several nights at Casanemo which is approximately 300 ft, 100 m. down the beach from Freddie's. I visited Freddie's several times for drinks and dinner. The two places are very much alike in terms of quality and ambiance. Freddie's has a dinner buffet beside the alacarte menu. The food is good and the service is exceptional despite the language barrier. Would recommend Freddie's as a viable alternative to Casanemo.", "I only stayed in Freddies for one night as I already had a booking in Casa Nemo for the remainder of my nights. Despite only staying there for one night, he looked after me for my entire stay. He was very helpful and kind and helped me rearrange my travel plans when my flight to arrive got delayed and my boat to leave got cancelled! I ended up arranging everything through Freddie as the staff at Casa Nemo weren't as helpful. The bungalows at Freddies are simple but designed with care and attention. They have everything you need for your stay (plenty of storage, towels, water, coffee making facilities, reading light, etc). My advice would be to ask for one with a hammock though as they don't all have one. I ate at Freddies every night as Freddie's cooking was so good. Even more", "I guess I was unlucky being here when Freddie is not around. We had to delay our journey to Pulau Weh because there's no available ferry due to bad weather condition. This is unavoidable but what happened next is just poor planning. We were offered a boat ride on a fishing boat. Small traditional type. This cost us IDR1,200,000. Expensive but we thought we just want to get to the island fast. Half way through our journey we had to turn back coz the sea was too choppy. We only get half of the payment back even though the boatman suggested to us to turn back coz it's not safe. We end forking out more money for accommodation in the city. Throughout all this nobody from Freddie's bothered to check on us. Luckily our driven Irfan was there. He's a good man. The next day we arrived", "During our 1 week stay in Sabang, we probably came here 4 times just for food, beer, and beach. Food is good and staff are nice. We really like the curry chicken and fried tempe. Fresh coconut also very good here.", "We had a very nice host and it was a wonderful stay, We were offered delicious meals, with a surprisingly tasty buffet dinner. The overall atmosphere was great and we really felt at home there. Freddie's staff was very helpful and helped us organise all of our next trips. We recommend it 100%", "The property is true to its pictures (warning: lots of step involved) and overall a good choice. Ambiance: welcoming. Staff: Almost everyone was extremely friendly (with the exception of one waitress who never smiled and seemed to resent us whenever we ordered something). Freddy himself was a great host. Arrival/Departure: We arranged transport to/from airport beforehand and things worked out perfectly (Freddy was also very clear and honest about pricing). Wifi worked fine. Location : outside the main village, with a semi-private beach and another hotel at about 500 m distance. You can go swimming without being harassed, you can also get lunch/dinner at the other place if you need a change, without venturing out into public. Beach: a little bit rocky, sometimes a strong current", "We enjoyed our stay here. The view is amazing from our rooms. The food is tasty and best of all, the services rendered by the friendly staff was great. I totally enjoyed having a chilled drink at the cafe or room while reading and enjoying the view. Very relaxing. The different buffet dinner theme nightly was a nice touch. Before the trip, I had difficulty in getting the transportation arranged from Banda Aceh airport to Pulau Weh as many of the drivers given by my friends were not operating due to the Eid-ul Fitri celebration. Thanks to Freddie, he got that sorted out. Freddies Santai Sumurtiga gets my highest recommendation.", "Beautiful Island and views. Food is great and Freddie\u2019s and expertly introduced by Freddie. I was disappointed on arrival as staff not so smiley and felt unhelpful. Different on our second day, just need to ask and very helpful and considerate. Wait staff were lovely and always had a cold beer for my demanding fianc\u00e9 \ud83d\ude00", "Just what we like. Not crowded, lovely beach, view, environment, food and staffs. Affordable price for accommodation and food. Wakes up to the sound of waves and sunrise. Fan room only, but it wasn't hot during our stay. We let the windows open throughout the night, no mosquitoes. Good selection for buffet breakfast. Would go back in a heartbeat. Stairs a bit steep.", "We arrived by cruise ship, and had a tour around the island. Our Bicycle Rickshaw driver, brought us here for a drinks stop. The location is breathtaking, the lodge is built into a sea facing hill, with direct beach access. The lodgings and dining facilities are rustic, but the views compensate. We ordered for non alcoholic drinks for 4USD! Would have loved to stay longer", "Freddies is a great place to stay, with a chill atmosphere. You come and you don't want to leave, we booked for five days and stayed two weeks. The bungalows are bright and comfortable with fantastic sea views. Breakfast is great, but Freddies buffet dinners are something you should not miss. The staff are all wonderful, happy and helpful. Tours can be arranged and you can easily rent a motorbike for the day. Snorkeling off the beach was great with so much to see.", "We have planned to go to Freddies several times and finally made it. We have stayed 7 nights with 3 adults in the 6 beds room right in front of the ocean and beach. The room was good for 3 adults but I wouldn't recommend it for more adults. Okay if you have kids. It was cleaned in a bigger cleaning with bed linen and towels changing every 3 day. The cleaning in between was just a small one like mopping the floor. Some areas could have been a bit more clean, but still okay us. If coming back I would prefer taking a bungalow a bit more up as the ocean right in front of the 3 family bungalows can be really loud and disturbing if you have a light sleep like me (luxury problem ;-) ). Freddie and the whole staff are amazing and offer great service. We have tried the Casa Nemo", "The place is so peaceful and relaxing. If you're looking for a place to escape from chaotic everyday city life, this is the one for you. The never ending sound of crashing waves is like a lullaby, we had 3 nights of deep sleep and woke up feeling fresh! The place was breezy throughout out stay there from Sept 19th - 22nd. It was sunny as well. We had enough dose of vitamin sea! My son loved playing at the beach in front Freddies. Quiet beach, a bit rocky though and the waves a bit strong for a 3yrs old but he still enjoyed it to the max! We just had to keep our eyes on him. During our stay, we ate at Freddies most of the time. We took breakfast buffet, had a la carte lunch and tried the different themed buffet dinner too. Overall we were satisfied with the food. It was delicious", "We spent around 3 days there, it situated at the very excellent location. We pay 60,000 rupiah for dinner and it was fantastic. There is a surau in front of the place where we can here azan clearly. Good for muslim to perform jemaah prayer there. the only drawback is no alternative restaurant around.", "Freddies is a great location for a sun drenched island holiday. food was good, location was good, staff where great. Their is lots to sea and do on the island.The only drawback is getting there. The best way is to fly from Medan, although this is heavily affected by the weather [our plane could not land the first day]. The other way is by ferry from the mainland [Banda Aceh] though in my opinion, this is not the easiest or the best way on or off the island", "We loved our stay at Freddies. It is in a beautiful setting with idyllic beach, reef just off shore, and palm trees swaying in breeze. The staff are very friendly and create a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The buffet dinner each evening is social and always tasty. The rooms are basic but have great views and are comfortable enough. We were able to arrange diving, snorkelling and motorbike hire through Freddies so although the resort is over the other side of the island from the main dive sites, you can still stay there and explore the whole island. It was also one of the only places in Sumatra where I could find a gin and tonic...so that is definitely a positive too!Cannot recommend enough.", "Beautiful seaside bungalow and de luxe rooms with great views, good food, excellent, friendly, personalized, service and so much more, all orchestrated by Freddie. The personal story of his involvement with Aceh that he narrated was heartfelt. All in all it was a very enjoyable holiday.", "We stayed with Freddies for five days and absolutely loved the hotel area and the beach. This is just paradise! The water was calm enough for children and inexperienced swimmers to learn how to snorkel and swim with the colourful tropical fish. There's a rope connecting the beach to a platform some 50 meters into the ocean, which is very useful when swimming with small children. You feel safe at all times. When reviewing a place like Freddie's you have to look at what kind of beach resort this is, because it is not a high-end luxury resort at all, but on the other hand they don't claim to be! Expect some tired bungalows without airconditioning and the occasional running toilet or dripping showerhead. But also expect a place where every guest is considered a part of the family,", "We spent the last two nights at Freddie's after traveling through Sumatra for a month. The bungalows are clean, linen is fresh and crisp and thoughtful touches. The food is exquisite and locally sourced. And Freddie and his staff are always on hand to assist in every way they can. Thank you for two days of bliss.", "Stayed for 1 night during our snorkeling trip we still amazed with the beautiness of this resort. clean and spacious room. 4 of us can stay yet still theres lots of space to tidy up our luggage. clean beach, amazing breakfast, too bad we cant stay to long but were definately go back here whenever we go to sabang next time!", "We love the great view from our rooms, palm trees and wide ocean. Its valuable for money, just 20mins from the jetty and town. It is perfect for an escape from the city and enjoy the wind and sunrise view from the balcony. They also have in-house restaurant so do not have to worry to go out and find foods. Except that is has a lot of stairs as its located on a cliff, not so suitable for elder people but slowly surely can survive! I would really love to comeback again as 1night is never enough", "I did not stay at Freddies. We were on our way back to Sabang, having visited the Japanese Fort at Anoi Itam, when our guide/driver suggested we drop by Freddie's for lunch. I am certainly glad that we did. Freddie's is located on a clift/slope with private access to a lovely stretch of beach. The colour of the sea was amazing with several shades of green. And the nice sea breeze was blowing on us through lunch. There's an open area in the restaurant. Very cozy and laid back. The food was okay but not spectacular. But who cares about the food when the ambience was just so nice? Service was a bit slow, but again, I didnt mind because I was enjoying the sea and sea breeze. I do not know what the rooms were like. But be warned that there are lots of stairs to climb, so", "We already enjoyed our stay so much, especially because of the sensational views. But Freddie took this to the next level - he was a friendly and very hospitality host. Each night we joining the nightly dinner and Freddie made a lot of efforts to speak to each and everyone personally. We really appreciate this. The room was comfortable enough, but with time I do think the rooms need an upgrade especially the bathroom. But besides this, we loved it and could have easily stayed much longer. Thank you to Freddie and the team!", "I booked 5 rooms and we all have nothing to complain here, everything is just perfect. Staff is so friendly and food in freddie also awesome. Its was worth of money stayed here and we all enjoy it. I am sure my family would come back and thank you again, Papa Freddie.", "Note: If you are looking for a Westin or Shangra-la Hotel, don't bother coming here. There is a cost to luxury travel destinations and accomodations. I'm not just talking about the price tag to the traveller. I'm talking about the cost to the destruction of the natural environment and fragile ecosystem such as in Sumur Tiga Beach in Weh Island. Where can you stay and sleep to the sound of rolling waves and watch coral fish swim and dart between rocks just 5 feet from shore in clear jade colored waters? At Freddies, I experienced all of the above and though I only stayed 2 nights, it was 2 nights in paradise. My family ate fresh seafood and drank fresh juices and whole young coconuts. We walked the prestine sandy beach and snorkle over the corals. I saw all kind of colorful fish", "The place is amazing, good value for the money, very good food! (I highly recommend the buffet dinners). Very nice view from the rooms, transport to and from the airport was very useful. The rooms are ok (average standard) but you can see that they had a good eye for details. Freddie is such a nice and welcoming person, makes you feel at home, like you are in a community. The beach in front of the hotel has quite some rocks and the waves are pretty strong, so you need to be careful when you enter the water.", "When you plan holidays to tour the world you might dream of stumbling upon hidden gems of places and special characters. Freddies is one of those places you dream about. It is stuck to a hillside overlooking a stunning beach and ocean view where gentle waves rock you to sleep at night. Freddies might be off the beaten track as is the whole island but ther is plenty to do. Snorkel with the turtles just a few metres from your beach, dive over an underwater volcano, lots of marine life. The island is beautiful and so are the people. Setting it all up for you from the heart of his kitchen is the inimmitable chef Freddy. I'm not going to tell you about him, you have to come here to meet him. Suffice to say he is one of the characters that make travelling so much fun, a real gem! Well", "We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Freddie's. Everything is well laid out, iur apartment was spacious and comfortable and lots of storage space. The buffet dinners and breakfasts were great and very good value for money. All the staff were friendly and Freddie himself was a gracious and welcoming host. We cannot wait to come back!", "We stayed in one of Freddie's bungalows on the beach and honestly couldn't have asked for a more perfect stay. We were supposed to stay for two nights in Iboih and then two nights at Freddie's but due to a cancelled flight we got to the island a day later than planned so decided to just spend the whole trip in Freddie's. He was incredibly communicative and accommodating in helping us arrange the extra night and organised transfers from the ferry so everything was in hand following a bit of a blip in our trip. From the moment we got there we couldn't have felt more cared for. There are two restaurants, one that runs throughout the day where you can order anything from seafood, to burgers, to milkshakes, to pasta/pizza etc. and then each night there is a large communal buffet", "Freddie is a wonderful person, loving and respecting his guests and staff. He is also a great cook! Don't miss his wonderful buffet dinners! And the bungalows are just great. We slept in the deluxe apartament - this means sleeping with the ocean just behind your windows. Amazing experience. Boys stayed in the bungalow with the ocean view. Wonderful view with the palmtrees everywhere and the amazing turquoise water. Thank you Freddie again for everything! Joanna with the family", "We had a wonderful time at Freddies! It's that kind of place that puts a smile on your face. The food is great, especially the buffet that is prepared and presented enthusiasticly by Freddie and his staff. The beach is beautiful, with crystal clear water making it perfect for snorkling. Beach chairs, towels and snorkling equipment are all available to use. We'll definitely come back here when we visit Pulauh Weh again.", "We were 3 and stayed in the new deluxe bungalow next to the beach that can sleep 6. Room 14: excellent location as it is closest to the beach and next to the restaurant. I was worried it'ld be noisy but not it was never so. Ideal for persons who want easier access to the beach and restaurant. Resort is on a hill so steep steps to get to other rooms from beach. In the room there is a mini fridge that you can chill your water and other drinks. Free drinking water that is filled up each day. Coffee and tea, towels, toilet paper, tissue paper and a bar of soap are provided. Make sure you bring your own shampoo. Restaurants: at the reception, serves buffet breakfast and buffet dinner, which is Freddie's main work area. Has a small library that you can pick up a book.

Freddy is helpful and all his stuff is friendly- no matter they are muslims, you can live a westernized life. This is not common in other parts of the Island. Just the best place at Freddies and with Freddy - thanks to you,l Freddy for making the only 3 days to a very Relaxing and great time for me!", "Really nice place on the beach. Small bungalows with hot water, great views and probably the best food on Sumatra. Host Freddie prepared amazing breakfasts and dinners all the time. Food is plentyful and delicious! Great value for money.", "To be fair to the property, let me first accept that we had arrived on a Sunday afternoon when local tourist traffic is high. Also Freddie was not there and i do think that's important. Anyway, we had been looking forward to our stay here and our expectations, based on reviews, were high. But on arrival we were not met by warm friendly staff. I was met by slightly disinterested and busy staff. Too busy to help me checkin. Too busy to help me and my wife with our luggage (they watched me struggle with 2 bags and a child all the way up the stairs, thru the restaurant and up to the room without even once offfering to help! Only at the end did I have to ask the person showing me to the room to help and even then he only offered one hand to help lift one end of the two bags I", "Nice and pleasant place to stay. But if you bring along your parents with a limited movement this place is not suitable for you. Lots of stairs. Other than that, buffet serve (breakfast and dinner) is good, but menu is change everyday. Lovely beach and very clean.", "- staff is so friendly. - room is awesome. i love the view from our balcony. it was amazing! - located infront of the beach. so breathtaking. the foods is cheap and awesome too! didn't expected it to be that cheap and delicious. would love to come here again soon!", "I want to preface my review by stating that my scores are based on being at a budget lodge, not in comparison to a full spectrum of hotels. It had a bit of funky, homemade feel. First off, the lodge is on a steep hillside with lots of stairs, so guests need to be agile to move around. The beach furniture and picnic tables near the beach were very uncomfortable. The beach was rocky. Staff made a hearty effort to clear the rocks from the beach, but getting into the water with the rocks and coral there made it quite difficult. The house reef for snorkeling was fabulous. The $7 US massage in out room was fabulous. The views from all areas of the resort were stunning. All of the eating areas were open air with expansive views to the ocean. The rental snorkeling equipment was", "If you have enough patience to get to Sabang, you will be rewarded once you get to Freddie's. Beautiful site, quiet, clean, excellent food, not to mention the warm welcome from Freddie himself for the evening buffet. He introduces his new guests and make sure everything is alright for them. He presents the menu for the evening. Staff is attentive and polite. Nothing negative whatsoever.", "Stayed here for 3 nights for diving in Weh. The food are fantastic (esp. the breakfast and buffet. Totally worth it!) and really amazed by the warmth from Freddie himself during our dinner. The room is clean and boy what a magical sunrise right in our window. Will definitely come back!", "We came here as a group of 8 and waited for 20 minutes before the waiter even took our order, which we had to ask him to do. A table of three girls complained they had already been waiting an hour for their food, which didn't bode well, they were told it would be 10 minutes more, but they elected to leave. The owner did waive their drink bill and apologise. We had to ask repeatedly for our drinks to be served to us, and they eventually arrived 45 minutes later. Three cokes and a beer, so hardly difficult to prepare. After an hour or more some of the food arrived, this coincided with two new waiters attending. The three outstanding steak meals arrived. The service did improve dramatically when the new waiters came on scene, and the owner did come and apologise for the delays. The", "Advantage: - Good location (close to Balohan harbour and Kota) - Nice view. Our room is facing beach - Friendly staff - Basic room; but towel, toiletries, mineral water, kettle, fridge, safety box are all provided - Nice balcony with hammock - Wifi provided Disadvantage: - Our ceiling fan room is not working, but its ok since Sabang is quite cold at night - The roof is leaking", "This is the most blissful and tranquil place you will ever visit! There is a true sense of feel-good around the place thanks to Freddie and his friendly, easy-going staff. Freddie himself is a gracious host and an absolute sweetheart! Don't expect 5 star luxury, but indeed 5 star hospitality. The rooms are rustic, but have everything you need, including a really good bed, fridge and free water/tea/coffee. And the most fantastic beach view from the balcony - complete with hammock and comfy chairs. And the beauty here is soul-soothing. It really is as amazing as you see on pictures. The snorkling right outside on the beach is some of the best on the island, and the water is crystal clear. My daughter and I have been travelling SE Asia for more than 3 months now, and this place", "We enjoyed 6 days on Pulau Weh at Freddie's. It is a great spot there and from the very first moment we felt welcome and cosy! We had a bungalow next to the restaurant. The view from there and from the restaurant is STUNNING at all times of the day! Bungalows are simple but clean and quite big. Had two electric fans in there and always hot water. Freddie is really a great host and tries his best to make it the best stay for every guest! He likes cooking and it is really good food he prepares night by night! We especially enjoyed and appreciated his get together in the evening. Before the \"Menu of the Day\" starts, he will welcome every single person, asking them how there day was spent and if they experienced something special. Than he talks about his day and tells about the", "We stayed at Freddies for a week and loved and enjoyed it so much. We travel much and saw great places but we never ever write a review. This time we just have to cause we where overwhelmed by the love he puts in his work. Freddie is the perfect host, takes care of everyones needs and makes you feel more than welcome. The beautiful place, the incredible food, and the love for the details makes it a real paradies ! Thank you Freddie for everything and a big compliment to your great staff! Michi & Tino", "Freddies was a very friendly and cosy resort. Very nice and service-minded personnel. The evening buffet was very good to a low price. The only not so good thing was that the monsun have removed all san on the beach.", "Freddie Santai Sumurtiga is one of the best place to stay and the location is good. Its near to town (Sabang). The view from this resort is wonderful and also from the room. The staff very helpful. The food from this resort is marvellous! Especially freddie's favourite pizza and also nasi goreng.

Cant really enjoy the sunrise/ sunset view since my eyes were disturbed by roof of room 14-16.. however, will come back to request other rooms except room 8.", "I book for bungalow that can accommodate 2pax but then i get deluxe bungalow or family bungalow i think.. Room no 10 ; - Too many bed inside the room - Too smelly We ask for room change, the staff lying said all room are full. I honestly admit that i cant stay on that room. Then suddently he said there are another room available. Room no 8 ; - Too many mattress inside - Too smelly - The toilet is very dirty - Dirty bedsheet with a hole on it. The bedsheet itself not fit for the bed. Your bed literally not covered. - No blanket. - Fan not working properly. Too hot. - You can hear Gecko sound literally every 3/4 hours. Very scary!! - No privacy. You can see someone inside because the curtain is transparent!! Conclusion : Not suitable for couple/pregnant lady if you get room", "Small, cute Bungalows with sea-view out of Bamboo. The beach is very nice for snorkeling. The bathroom is a little bit too small and not the youngest one. The restaurant serves good food. But the service is very slow.

With his staff they will do all they can to make your stay as relaxing and enjoyable as possible", "Freddies is like a home away from home and it was the best place we stayed in Sumatra! Rooms have fantastic view over the see, the coral reef is just outside the hotel and every night Freddie cooks the most fantastic dinner and creates an atmosphere of home and being one big family. Highly recommended!", "Really warm welcome. Freddie has a big warm heart and makes you feel at home. His homemade menu is the best, with daily evening speech including nice insides of the Island, funfacts, education and menu introduction! Dinner at Freddie is like dining with family, all guest feel as one group enjoying the good life! He is taking care of his guest like a parent. Private guesthouse beach and best beachview ever. Room had a private balcony as well. Also have to mention: NO MOSQUITO's !!! Also really recommend the massage!! two lovely ladies from the kitchen have such good hands, wish i could go back. Many thanks and a big hug to Freddie!!!", "Fantastic location on the sea front. Generous sized room. Could have done with air con though. The bathroom water tended to come and go. Food in the evening was great. Having said that we were a bit put off with the number of cats and flies in the kitchen. The chef and assistants smoked while preparing the food. At one point one of the kitchen staff was cutting his toe nails!!", "Wow wow wow. Freddie has built an empire that's absolutely amazing. The rooms are basic but have everything you need. The view is the best one I've ever had. The staff is absolutely great, even when Freddie isn't there (he was away for business when we were there). Our fan stopped working in the room, and they replaced it with a new one on the same day. There's also a big water reservoir in your room that contains drinking water. Awesome service! The restaurant has good food, good service and even some WiFi :) The beach is beautiful and clean. The ponton in the water is my favorite hangout. On a rainy day we asked for a driver to drive us around some places on Sabang, which was pretty nice. The best part was that we found out that we stayed at the most beautiful spot of", "Not the most luxurious resort on the planet. Yet, there is one good reason for all the positive reactions here at Trip advisor: Freddy and his team are a rare species of passionate hosts that will do anything to make your stay at Pulau Weh pleasant. The co-operation, efforts and joy of the staff are inspirational. Staying at Freddie's feels like staying at home, only it's in a eco-friendly tropical paradise. PS: forgot to mention: sunrises can be sensational, sleep with the sound of the waves coming in and enjoy the variety of fresh and healthy foods from the kitchen.", "Initial communication with Freddie was excellent, he replied to emails very quickly. We had a few problems with a poor guest house in Llokgna and needed somewhere to store our luggage, Freddie to the rescue not only free luggage storage at his restaurant in Banda Aceh but also collection of same and of us to the ferry port and to his place. We'd originally booked for 2 nights, but changed to 5 within an hour or so of being there, it was beautiful, several bamboo/wooden chalets set above the ocean with a wonderful restaurant and bar.Staff were all friendly and helpful with absolutely no hard sell of trips etc although they were available along with some very nice drinks such as Bacardi and decent whisky even during Ramadan.

Let him know you want to get there and spend some time... he will help you arrange that holiday once you've booked that flight. Just send him an email. I travel the world...and Freddies has been my all time favourite since I found his resort fives years ago. We returned last winter to spend 10 days residing in his newest accommodations built closest to the beach. Wow! Sleeps a family... has a mini fridge, large bathroom with plenty of hot water, large veranda with furniture that overlooks the beach. We just booked our flight to return this coming winter.

I am going back to Indonesia for another dive trip and I asked my girlfriend where she wants to go she says Fredies well I better post a review.

Freddie will take care of calling the dive shop for a pick up and motorcyles making your stay easy.", "Just confirming my cousin's review from couple weeks ago. Magical place and a great customer service by Freddie. Mind blowing dinner experience, we could stay there for weeks but had to check other places out.

Martin & Marcel from Slovakia (living in Canada)", "Gorgeous view towards Sumur Tiga Beach. Room is clean, bathroom as well. Big balcony to relax and blend with the ocean sounds. Love the resto upstair more than the one downstair (less-professional, heard it was different management). Breakfast is different every day and taste good! Dinner Buffet is beyond expectation, felt almost like in a proper Wine Dinner but island style! Feel lucky to meet the legendary Freddie, he is very friendly and helpful! Easy to communicate. Will definitely come back!", "We went there last weekend, and it was perfect! Nice place, cool view from our room, and delicious food. Love it! Special thing about this place is dinner time.

Best beach, best sunrise ever, best environment and really friendly staff. And Freddi , amazing owner and always caring about all guests. The food prepared by them is awesome and they organise for you the activities that you want. Plenty of things to do in Sabang. Definitely I'll come back!!", "Freddies Santai is the best place to be at at Pulau Weh. The people are friendly, the atmosphere is calm and the beaches and houses are beautiful.

We had a very wonderful night stay at here. The staffs are very friendly, the room is soo big there are 5 beds on my room and all of them were set neatly (I stayed at the deluxe apartment room).

Totally going back again someday!", "We did not stay here but we ate here for every meal. The evening meals have a lot of variety and Freddy makes it feel like home with his stories and his welcomes.

Great choice to stay on the island!", "My partner and I actually stayed at Freddie's other place just down the road- Ujung Karang, which we found a bit more quiet and peaceful. We had a lovely large bungalow on the cliffs overlooking the sea, where we were told was great for snorkeling. The sea was too rough though whilst we were there. The photos are from our last night when the sky turned a beautiful pink colour at sunset! We ate breakfast and dinner every day at Freddie's; the location was beautiful- right on the beach. The food was pretty good too! All the staff we encountered throughout our stay at both locations were very friendly and helpful. We rented a scooter for two of the days we were there to get out and see the island. Kilometer zero was worth the drive just to say we had been to point zero of", "The food and atmosphere is superb at Freddies. The food (four-course dinner) is excellent and the personnel friendly and helpful. The bungalows are clean and the view from the bungalow is great and since the bungalows are so close to the beach you fall asleep each night to the sounds of the waves. We spend 6 weeks in Indonesia and this was probably the best place we stayed at. The snorkling at Freddies is also great.", "We came late evening and we enjoyed quiet & peaceful beach waiting for dinner. The dinner was a buffet with Freddy explaining all the dishes and we were surprised that there was very big choice of vegetarian. We were served the soup & starter on our tables and the rest was the buffet style. The homemade dessert was excellent.

Hot water with fan and veranda looking onto to the beach. The restaurant and bar is amazing too and was the only place where we had decent dinners for that amout of $$ we paid the whole trip so take advantage of the buffet and eat as much as you can while youre there.

Freddy and the staff are amazing they", "Thanks to the recommendation of our Indonesian friend we stayed at Freddie's and we really enjoyed it. The bungalows are very clean and beautiful with an amazing view and also the sea in front is incredible. We stayed 4 nights but we had dinner only once because it was too late for us, but it was delicious and Freddie prepared special food for my diet. The only very annoying thing were the locals who came and sit at the beach with their drinks and starring at all the western girls whom were sun bathing. Also @ Bungalow 3 the prayer calls a very very loud because the speakers are in its direction, but beside all that was great to be there.", "My girlfriend and I stayed at freddies in september 2014 and we had a great time, we ate most meals at at the top resturant and the buffet food was great and cheap..freddie and his staff do a great job, the rooms are comfortable and relaxing ..sabang is a great little friendly island with really good diving and snorkeling. .We hire a scooter and explored the island , the traffic is quiet and the people are friendly, I recommend Freddies and hope to return one day", "I was in one of Freddie's bungalows(number 7 )and had a blast. I loved the place so much that I kept extending my stay.Trust me, it will be hard to leave this paradise ;) Freddie is a great guy and so is his place. Would not hesitate to come back, and I hardly ever come back to the place Ive visited before. p.s the view from the balcony is stunning...", "Freddies is just perfect! The accomodation in bungalows is not the most luxury but it is right on the very nice beach. You can find corals just a few meters from the shore. What is a life-time experience is Freddie himself and especially his couisine. Freddie prepares, with the help of his staff, all breakfasts and dinners. The food there is spectacular, you must order the dinner. It is so delicious! I would also recommend taking part in a snorkling trip. They take you on many spots around Pulau Weh. For me the best part of our vacation! Go and enjoy! Freddies the best!", "Freddie, our host made us immediately felt at home and took care of our well-being and interests. He and his team ensured a smooth and memorable holiday for their guests. Well done on the team efforts! The room was simple (we were in room number 1) and you should be glad to have a clean and sitting toilet with toilet paper and it flushes. Note that not all places even in museums or resorts have this standard. If you are someone looking for luxury, then this is not the type of room you are looking for. In the room, you have an ensuite shower, toilet, basin. The beds, pillows and sheets are simple. There is a fridge, fan and rack. You may also request for a mosquito net if needed.

There's a beautiful private beach where you can wear bikini, and the food served is the best that I've ever had in any guesthouse I've ever been.

The place is incredible and Sumur Tiga is one of the best beach in Pulau Weh. The food is excellent, I really love Freddies Fave Pizza - like ordered it every day during 3 days staying in this wonderful bungalows.

Our room could sleep up to 5 people, had two huge ceiling fans, water dispenser, hot shower, fridge and a secluded balcony over the sea. As soon as possible, sign yourself up to the buffet ( don't worry, there was always plenty of food cooked). You will encounter the most delicious food on the island at a very reasonable price.mthere is a separate kitchen where you can order food from a menu but the quality and service is not as good as the food Freddie prepares himself.

As a host, he knows how to", "We really enjoyed our time at Freddies. Freddie is a wonderful host and chef. OPme things were a bit quaint like school camp - at dinner each night introducing the new guests, asking about their activities that day and fare welling those leaving the next day. It personalised the experience. The buffet dinner each night was the best food we had on the two weeks we were travelling and we would return for that alone. The rooms were adequate the beach excellent and plenty of fish were seen snorkelling just off the beach. Only down side was the 4am roosters and the 5.15am call to prayer but again that is part of the experience.", "We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and even extended it by two nights. The food is purely delicious and Freddie makes you feel welcome and looked after. I guarantee you won't be disappointed! ( the prayers at 5 am can be a little sleep disturbing)", "Freddies is a lovely place to stay. It offers amazing views over the water and it is attached to a local beach that seems to only be used by guests of Freddie, making it very relaxing. The water is very tropical and the snorkelling there is fantastic. The rooms are very basic and the beds are relatively comfy. The bathrooms are simple but the showers offer hot water. There is a free supply of filtered water in the room which is a great touch as it stops you having to continually buy bottled water. The rooms are cleaned daily. Be prepared to be woken up by the call to prayer at 5am each morning as the rooms are very close to the Mosque. Maybe request a room further away from the Mosque if this is possible. The food that Freddies offers is great, especially the evening buffets.", "My son and I spent 3 nights at Freddies at the beginning of June and loved it. We were looking for an unpretentious place to relax on the beach and snorkel and this was perfect. We had a room on the upper levels so had a spectacular view of the beach and water from our balcony (see picture). The snorkelling was excellent right off of the beach and the floating platform was nice for resting. The beach is not private, so it tended to get busy mid to late afternoon when many school children visited. However, at other times it was almost deserted. The free wifi worked well and our room was comfortable, although a bit hot at night even with all the windows open (the fan really helped though). Freddie is very welcoming and organized our ferry transfer and day trip of", "a little piece of paradise in Sumatra! The friendly owner Freddie offers 9 clean beach-bungalows and 3 family rooms on the 3rd level of the main buidling, each with en-suite bathroom (hot shower) and balcony with seaview and fitted hammock. All rooms are equiped with a fridge, roof or standing fans, a free coffee and tea station, water dispenser and a safety box. I fall in love with the beach view from our balcony. The only downside was the bed felt springy but who cares when the view and service is good.", "The first thing you'll notice about Freddie's is the swiftness of his replies to your queries along with his comprehensive answers. And this is great. He's been doing this a while and he works with good people (Ifan his driver/guide in Bandar Aceh is superb), you won't be let down and this is important in Aceh really as it's not really geared to western tourists yet and English levels are low. The resort has a wonderful outlook through palm trees out to see but the height of the chalets above the rocky beach may worry parents of small children. The sea breeze is fairly constant so lack of AC not so much a problem. The chalets are a good size with practical features like hooks - why so few of these type of places bother with hooks? For those who have been travelling a while", "For the people who are negative, please stay in your spoiled over budgeted hotels!!! This place is unruined by big dollars, it's all about you need from the basic and more. Freddie and his team are so hospitable. Travelled a lot but this is a true paradise spot. A whole week to go!!!", "Freddie gets 5* but not the accommodation which is faded and jaded and generally run down. The beach is not cleaned by the staff so it's covered in a lot of rubbish. The neighbour tosses his rubbish out. of the back if the house and it's piling up nicely. There is building work going on, not terribly noisy but the cement is being mixed right by the shower down by the beach and it runs onto the beach. If you go with no great expectation you will no doubt have a great time, but the price tag is hefty for what you get.", "My mom and I stayed at Freddie's for four nights in Feb. 2015. We loved our bungalow with its sea view and sea breezes. The food was amazing, and Freddie and his staff were extremely hospitable. He even went out of his way to help us book seats on Garuda's new flight from the island back to Medan, and one of his staff disinfected my toe for me when I came back from snorkeling with some scrapes. If you are looking for beach, this is not the place to stay because of the rocks and heavy surf. (My mom got pummeled trying to get out to snorkel, and it was so rough that I was actually seasick while snorkeling and had to return to shore!). However, it's a great place for leisurely walks on the beach, rock-hunting, and relaxing. I highly recommend that you stay at Freddie's!!", "My wife and I spent an excellent 11 nights at Freddies and although there was no aircon, the afternoons were breezy, the nights cooling and the early mornings cold. The sound of waves crashing onto shore provided us such a relaxing atmosphere and made our sleep so therapeutic. Except for 2 nights, we had all our dinners at Freddies (both buffet and ala carte) and it was nothing short of super-licious. Freddies legendary pizza was really worth its good ratings and is a must try. It was our first time visiting Pulau Weh and we came for fun diving...all 11 days with Rubiah Tirta. Though we had to commute 30 mins daily to/from to the dive centre, it was a very pleasant ride with the countryside + coastal sights along the way...and this was free courtesy of Rubiah Tirta. We truly", "I stayed only 2 days, but it was unforgettable... 2 thumps up, outstanding, what else I can say, hahahha... The best place ever!!!! Uncle Freddie is so nice and also a great chef. I want to go back someday & wish I can stay longer. For suggestion, please provide air conditioner because the room is little bit hot at night", "We stayed at freddies one week and felt all the time so comfortable. he is a great cook and a wonderful person. everytime we needed help, he and his stuff had been always helpfull and pleasant.we would like to come back.", "We stayed at the rustic and comfortable Freddies Santai Sumurtiga for 5 nights and had a great time. The location is right beside the sea so if you like listening to the waves directly below at night and waking up to look out at crystal clear water, or watching dolphins playing while you eat your breakfast then you'll love this place. While the location is spectacular it's Freddie who's the real star. He was an excellent host, always responsive to email from the beginning of our booking and happy to give advice and arrange travel logistics, making the whole process of getting to Pulau Weh from Aceh easy and stress free. Don't hesitate about booking the evening four course dinners that he and his friendly staff arrange each night. Freddie starts the evening with a detailed", "Beautiful views. Lovely beach. Good food. Friendly people. I had a very enjoyable and insanely relaxing stay at Freddie's. The bungalows are simple and lovely. Hot water is provided at all hours. The place is well integrated into the the surroundings and into the local community. I didn't want to leave!!", "Pretty nice and cozy place for relaxing and snorkeling. We liked it very much, only the neighbour who is some weirdow and does not like westerners, sort of spoiled our vacation. He uses a megaphone to pray ever day early in the morning: Anyway the beach is nice, water clear . the bungalows are clean and have a nice view. The breakfast doughnuts are awesome", "I stay here for 3 nights. It's quite a trek for a long weekend from Jakarta but once you get there it is paradise. Amazing value, wonderful location and good food. Freddie treats his staff like an extended family. Highly recommended.", "We stayed with Freddie for 4 days and loved it. His beach is perfect and the snorkelling while we were there was the best we have seen. And best off all it is directly off the beach. We stayed in the family room over the restaurant which is basic but has everything you need. Perfect for a family of 4 people. The view from the balcony is lovely. We are vegetarians and our son has celiac disease, so feeding us isn't easy. Freddie and his amazing staff made us the most amazing food. Breakfast and dinner are served 'family' style and is all delicious and extremely affordable. The separate restaurant by the beach is also great with a wide selection of food and drinks. Honestly we never felt like we needed to leave for anything. Thanks Freddie and crew for the lovely stay!", "I continued my trip from iboih to sumur tiga, what a life in here \ud83d\ude0a so relaxing, and good food! The peoples around the island are quite relegion, but as long as you are inside the freddie's area its doesnt matter if we want to enjoy the beach with swimsuite! Even You can have alcohol drink from freddie's bar to enjoy your night with the sorrounded of waves...", "Stayed at Freddies last year and fell in love with it. The location is the best! You can just look outside your window and the sea greets you. You can just sit on the diner area and the wind welcomes you. My perfect scenery when I go to the beach! Not to mention that Freddie himself is a very kind and humble man, honored to meet him! And one thing for sure, you HAVE TO try his cooking! Wonderful! One of the best dining experience I've had so far in my life. He cooks with heart and you can feel it in your mouth and your stomach. Not to be missed!", "I think the bungalows are quit good value. We liked the open sea view. First we stayed in Iboih for two nights and then 2 nights at Freddie's. The perfect combination. It's much more quiet at Freddie's, so if you are looking for the travellers vibe, I would not recommend it. You should at least try the dinner buffet once. It is a nice fusion of Indonesian, African and Western with a lot of passion :-) Freddy took into account my individual wishes (vegetarian). The snorkelling is ok in front of the resort, you can see that the coral still needs more time to recover from 2004 tsunami, but the fish are there (and a lot of old coral as well, which still makes it nice)", "Did not stay here, but visited regularly to use the beach cafe, and to swim on the beach in front. It was Ramadan, and Freddie's was one if the very few places open on the island that would serve lunch, cold beer , and gin and tonics. Food was good Service was good Beach has a few rocks and sometimes a strong cross tide. Overall the experience was really good. Freddie's also has a Resturant in Banda Aceh with we visited , the food and service there was also fantastic. Freddie's has the right formula for a region that is struggling to understand exactly what western tourists are looking for!", "This review is relative to other accommodations on this island, not in the world in general. Staff: Freddie runs a tight ship while being totally friendly and warm, everything runs very smoothly. He is amazing. Food: best on the entire island! Made our lives better to look forward to the nightly buffet...Freddie somehow woks miracles with the menu. Very affordable. Room: sea view, nice fan, high up from beach and breezy, didn't require mosquito net, clean and basic with a balcony. Room number 5 where we stayed did have some chickens outside but was otherwise pretty quiet. Activities: good snorkeling and swimming, can rent a scooter to tour the island, can set up scuba or snorkeling All in all we very much enjoyed our stay, thanks to Freddie! Splitting our time between Casa Nemo", "Actualy we don't stay here. I'm here to comment the restaurant which is kinda major issue in here sabang. Not so many variation of food here, even at the city they start they activity (interm of food n place to eat) at 8am-2pm after that they close n open again on 5pm. So especialy if u choose to stay around sumur 3 area, this fredies is one of the best restaurant! For the service it is a bit slow but totally worth to wait for. Really. Especially for the pizza..omj that the best pizza in the island. Totally need to try if u visiting sabang. We visit sabang for 4daya and spend 3 night for dinner at fredies eventhough we dont stay here. Totally get spell by the pizza.

The boats entering in Balohan. It s a resort with much stairs nicely located at the beach and every bungalow faces the sea. There is a huge amount of personel hanging around the day, there english is bad, sometimes it seems they can not speak, Freddie send them on english course! Freddie is the one who takes care of everything, kitchen, solving problems etc etc. Announcing the diner is a party at itself, if you stay at freddies eat there, it s everyday a big surprise and the quality is also great and for asia the variety you get for me the best experience,", "We booked in advance 2 Bungalow\u2026 Because the first night was fully booked, we took a family room, and than would change to the 2 bungalow for the following 5 days. After we arrived, not welcomed friendly, we got our room close to the restaurant, where the music at the evening was on quite late and loud. After got wake up at 6 from our neighbors for the following hour, we could sleep again. Then got woken up again from the stuff because the \"second\" booked room. In the end, we had not 2 Bungalows, instead we had 2 rooms clause to the restaurant, at the end of Freddys, where garbage was everywhere between the palms. After informing and kindly asking the responsible staff, if we could change our rooms to 2 bungalows, like the reservation, the answer was: there are no free", "Freddies Santai Sumurtiga is a quite famous place to stay in Sabang, so me and my friend booked a bungalow for our visit in Sabang.

Our bungalow has a ceiling fan and table fan, 1 big bed and 1 single bed, a balcony, clean and bright bathroom, and clean towels. For breakfast, lunch, and dinner, you have to pay extra if you want to eat at the the hotel restaurant, they have an open kitchen with local chef who cooks various kind of menus. They also have a cafe which handled by locals. I can't stop drink the coffee, so good. When we came there the weather was not good, one day we have rain all day, so we had nothing", "It was such a surprise! I've been here for a month and enjoyed every moment. Briefly: this is a traditional style well built place with Western cleanliness and great 'fusion' food as highest standards. The bathrooms are brand new and there's room cleaning every day. Even after a month the diversity of the dishes on the evening buffet don't stop amazing - and Freddie himself is cook and presents the menu at night. Traditional style bungalows are lined up against the water front and on the hillside, each with a spacious balcony overlooking the sea. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I would like too tell them all: Thank you for being my friends and offering a feeling of being \"home\". Absolutely worth the detour, even if it's just to taste the buffet ;-) (reserve in advance)", "freddie's is just a perfect place to relax. the bungalows are simple but well equiped (fridge, water dispenser, water boiler, hammock, etc...) and situated in a beautiful scenery right on the beach. the staff is amazing and the food delicious, although it's not very light. we stayed for ten nights...and after that it was really hard to leave - thank you freddie, janis and the rest of the staff for a great time!!", "We loved Frediies!

They made a beautiful decoration for us. Thank you for the surprise, we love it. All rooms facing the sea, so you can chillax at your own balcony. To bad we just manage to booked only for 1 night.

Please people, If you want to fight just slow down you volume. By the way You wont regret staying at Freddies.", "The rooms are basic but very clean & comfortable. The views magnificent. Hotel location perfect. Caution for the elderly & young children because of many steep steps. Freddie is a wonderful host & his staff very friendly & helpful. The themed buffet dinners each night are excellent & very good value. The a la carte restaurant is also very good. Breakfast buffet varied & very good. Transport from airport to ferry & ferry to hotel was dealt with very efficiently. We recommend this hotel & are already looking forward to another visit.", "3rd time in here.

Watch out for the strong current as tide moves in and out.", "Nice sea view from my room. Room with freezer and a big bottle of drink water\ud83d\ude0a. But no aircond but its ok for me. There are quite dengerous stairs going down to reception & cafe area and going to the beach. So be careful with your kids. Not suitable lodging for 'warga emas' or disable person. Next trip i will prefer book room no 1@2", "At Freddies do not expect 5 star hotel but wat you get makes up for the things you would otherwise get. The bungalows are at the edge of the sea. When you take a picture on your balcony it is like a commercial for the island life: beatiful beach ,blue sea... Our host prepares a special meal every evening ( like Indian , Italian,..food) It is very good food. One night the kids did not like the special he and his friendly staff had prepared. In other places they would leave the restaurant hungry but Freddie saw it and ordered a different meal for the kids that they did enjoy very much. Thank you Freddie. We loved to stay with you and I recommend you greatly.", "love the ambience and surrounding area stay in bungalow chalet the view so stunning facing the open sea foods was so good and pls try Freddies signature pizza with the chips you can rent a motorbike to ease you for sightseing pls take note checkout at 1000am, and not 1200pm", "We travelled as a family of 5, 2 adults, children 6, 9 & 11. We had a fabulous time here at Freddie's. The staff were all so friendly and Freddie himself always goes out of his way to help you. The beach in front of Freddie's is postcard beautiful. You can snorkle from this beach but the sea can be quite strong at times. The rooms was basic but clean with a fan and fridge and fresh drinking water. Dont go here if you want 5star luxury regular hot water and all the mod cons. This gave our children the taste of travelling that we had hoped in a safe friendly environment. Thank you Freddie and co!", "Freddie, the owner, is very friendly and so is the rest of his staff They have a different diner buffet every night, which you can chose to join or not. It's nice to have a change in the regular Indonesian menus (the cuisine is from Indonesia and elsewhere, always fresh and daily prepared by the staff, so a great mix) Lots of games to chose from during a rainy afternoon The hotel is right on the beach, so really nice to go have a swim, relax on the beach or have a walk around Nice sea view from the room and hammock Good spot to go snorkeling too The rooms were slightly dated, but Freddie let us know that they are rebuilding quit a bit in the hotel at the moment, so by next year, it'll all be updated :) This didn't make the stay less nice though", "Freddies is a Paradise on earth! Best location, best place to stay at in Sabang. If you're not planning to go to Sabang go to Sabang, the ferry is only 45 minutes from the mainland, and the ferry is very well maintained and safe. Wonderful Owner and staff. A real family environment or great getaway for Couples. Stunning views of the crystal clear water. Beautiful Beach. All the staff were super friendly and helpful. Not overcrowded. Very peaceful. Very reasonably priced for stay and food. I stayed for 2 nights, but wished I stayed for longer. I will definitely be going back at some point.

When we went it was really hot climate. There is no air conditioner in the rooms. Because the rooms are build off with nature materials. And the fans in the rooms are not that great to get cool down. Also the toilet accessories are rusted, but what to do. I had to use it.", "Really nice place, the view is epic. We would recommend the Bungalows #1-4 for the best view! We would also recommend to join Freddy\u2019s dinner. It was so delicious and enough for everyone. Snorkeling at the reef in front of the resort was great! Saw two stingrays, a turtle and a lot of different fish. For activity I would recommend to rent a scooter and drive along the island. Really beautiful landscape.

We stayed in a family suite which directly overlooked Pulau Wet beach and sea. Amazing view which gave us pure happiness. The suite itself is simple, in my opinion it can have some maintenance update. To refer to the sliding doors. But it does not resist us of us as family intending to come back next year to Freddies! I wish you and your staff all the best! I would definitely recommend anyone to come and experience Pulau Wet at Freddies", "Arrived here for 3 days, had a brilliant experience.

They have one of the most beautiful beach in Sabang and just a step a head, the foods especially bf and dinner was perfect for us. And i like short welcoming word (or small ceremony?) during dinner. It feels warm and create a good ambience. The rooms and the facility is good. The staff was very helpfull and always smile.

Just when my hubby asked for cattle replacement. Your staff said. We can asked for hot water from kitchen. For me it's sound terrible. The shower pressure was so low.

Then you step down many steps to the restaurant/office area where we were greeted by Yon., a member of staff who is really kind and helpful. Up yet more steps to the room......horrid.

We were looking for somewhere with good food and good snorkelling at a reasonable price and we found it at Freddies. The 2 bungalows were lovely and immaculate and Freddie booked us into 2 adjoining ones which was fabulous. The food was delicious especially, as many reviewers mention, the buffet dinner. The highlight for us was the snorkelling - right outside Freddies is a lovely snorkel and we also did a day trip - wonderful diversity of fish.

Thank you for a lovely family holiday - we hope to be back.", "I have visited Freddies with family and friends. The beach is direct front of the place.

Its worth it to come back and stay at Freddies again when we are in Pulau Weh :)", "Freddie's is one of the best places I've stayed in across Asia. The bungalows are interwoven with dreamy palms and a lovely beach below. But it's the personal touch, the helpful staff and Freddie's legendary dinners that make this 'really something special'.

But Monster Divers arranged a free pick up and I enjoyed the scenic rides especially with a hot shower and four course dinner waiting for me at Freddie's.", "Best restaurant, best service, a unique place where you just feel good.

The beach is uncrowded with a rope leading to an offshore floating raft making it safe to swim for weaker swimmers. The dinners buffet each evening is on a special theme which Freddie decides the night before. It's excellent value and the most distinctive food on Palau Wei. Freddie and all the staff make one very welcome and they are always happy to help. For example, when I locked my safe key in the safe, the workers spent quite some time resolving this silly mistake and remained cheerful!

New owner going to replace him. Hope he stays healthy n as usual, cheerful..", "Stayed here for 3 nights. It's a nice place. However, sometimes there might be noisy tourists stay above your room. But Freddy will take care for your complaint. Family bungalow sea view is the best room in my opinion, here you'll get beautiful view and nice sound of the sea. Don't forget to book a buffet dinner because the food is tasty. One of a great place to stay in Sabang. Good job!", "Stayed for 2 nights while in Pulau Weh. The room was facing the clear blue sea and was pleasantly surprised by the sunrise view. Freddie is accomodating and constantly check on his guests to make sure everything is okay. My stay here became one the highlights of my trip to Aceh.", "We had a really great stay at Freddies Santai Sumurtiga. The beach is clean and beautiful and really good for snorkeling. Freddie himself is a very attentive host. He establishes personal contact with all guests and has many informations for his guests. Also he helps to organize trips.

There is lots to see and do on the island", "Freddies Santai Samurtiga is one of the best places I have ever been and Freddie is by far the best host I have ever met.

But when i and my husband arrived on 20, madam at reception with calmly said that all rooms are occupied. They said there is a miscommunication when we booked the room and suggested us to refund our money and find another hotel. It's not about money or room, but no confirmation or call you canceled our room, that such a bad bad impression for famous hotel in Sabang. Shame you and GOOD LUCK!", "Great accomodations, good food an drinks and comlete customer service at Freddies. We were wnjoying staying ad Freddies. We are reccomendet Freddies to all travaliers. Mr Freddi arranged taxi driver, scooters and airport transfer for resonable price.", "We asked so many questions before visiting Weh. Freddie always replied in a timely manner and with all details he can advise. He's very gentle and helpful. We appreciate that a lot. We came to snorkel at Weh. The experiences were beyond our expectations. Although most of the water activities are around Rubiah Island/Iboih Beach area. But the sea in front of Freddies is something you can't miss. It is a coral forest I would say, as long as you would dare to swim out like 50 -100 meters from the beach. You will explore the vast coral gardan with fishes. I saw a lobster and a lion fish. Breathtaking view when it's sunny day and calm sea.", "Freddie is by far the most the most helpful and careing hotel manager I ever met, and I have stayed in a lot of places. Freddie can make trip here and back very easy. The rooms are of the simple kind but still has what you need + a nice cosy tropical feeling.

Will come back again but definitely not in the family room again. Overall nice place, nice view and good food", "Fantastic views, friendly staff and Freddie is one of the most hospitable owners I have ever came across in my travels. The weather was perfect for swimming, snorkelling, and generally lazing about on the private beach.", "An absolutely wonderful place and a highlight of Sumatra! It was so peaceful and laid-back but at the same time offered us many opportunities for day-trips on Weh, to Banda Aceh, or snorkeling and diving along the different beaches. You can ask the team for any day trips and they will be happy to provide you the contact. In Banda Aceh, Heri (0062 852 6058 98 52) a local guide took us on a wonderful day tour and showed us some very interesting and unusual places. Freddie and Co. are such wonderful and hearty hosts that we felt at home immediately. Staying at Freddie's we had rather the feeling of visiting someone we know than simply staying at a hotel and we enjoyed it very much!", "This place was recommended by my friends & once my friend & I arrived here, we understand why. Freddi is very nice person. We rent a room for 2 days. The room was perfect. The view is breathtaking. The breakfast & dinner buffet also great. It was nice when Freddi greet his guest before the dinner start. We also ask Freddi to arrange the transportion from airport to the resort. Everything when smoothly from the beginning except for one thing. The transporter from Balohan to Freddi is scamming us. We didn't agree on any trip after we check in, as we want to rest & decide later. On day 3, we bump into him at Iboih, and he ask us to pay him for the 'cancel' trip. My advise, please confirm clearly on anything to avoid miscommunication and additional cost.", "This place is awesome, really nice bungalows and rooms with sea view. Everything was really clean, they clean the room every day. The owner and his staff taking great care on their guests. It's a place to relax and chill on the beach, or doing some snorkeling right in front of the guesthouse. They organise snorkeling trips around the island, also scooter rental. The food in the restaurant is so delicious, in the morning they offer a very nice breakfast buffet and in the evening a must try dinner buffet, it's like a captains dinner at a cruise where you're welcomed by Freddie itself. Really nice and tasty food with a special atmosphere. When I left with two other guests Freddie organise our trip to the airport and it worked perfect. When we arrived with the ferry in Banda Aceh", "We stayed for 4 nights in Freddie's on the outskirts of Sabang on Pulau Weh in Bungalow 13. From the moment we arrived Freddie couldn't do enough to make sure that our stay was a great one. Our bungalow was spacious and had great views over the beach and sea. His team are friendly and helpful and carry the same ethos as Freddie. If you do stay at Freddie's I would thoroughly recommend the one day snorkelling trip. It is very reasonably priced, you are taken to the boat, stop off at about four different places to snorkel and swim over an underground volcano which is amazing. The trip was hosted by Andy who was informative and helpful and pointed out octopus and other things that were not always easy to see. The variety and colours of the fish were amazing and there was loads to", "It was love at the first sight! Recommend those who love the beach and sound of the waves! The food is delicious too!

After travelling for 3 months alone with my 3 year old son this place was a dream. He could roam free as it was all safe and I could relax. The beach is beautiful and loved that I could order a massage to my room. I stayed in both the standard bungalow and the deluxe room as the bungalow was fully booked. I really loved the bungalow so much, it was super cute and cosy and even came with a fridge, drinking water and tea coffee facilities. The place has a lovely hot water shower too :-). It was my birthday when I was there and Freddy got me a little cake and got everyone to sing happy bday to me which was really sweet. Was hoping to go back to freddies before I left but he was fully booked. Can see why as it\u2019s a great place :-) thanks Freddie.", "Nice place, very cozy & view superb from our room.

I think the room need upgrading esp the furnitures, mostly wear off & messy.. The rest , everything okay. The furniture", "I really enjoy staying at Freddies..waking up with the sound of wave and delicious breakfast although I think the quality of coffee can be improve because Aceh is known for best coffee in Indonesia. Plenty of space in the room and nice warm shower after a hectic day..very refreshing dinner. I am really looking forward to come back and stay longer. The owner is very friendly and chat with us in the morning. Thank you very much for the great services.", "I came to the island sabang for refreshing my mind, and it does.

There are rotting smells from beneath the balcony .", "Excellent view with really2 affordable price, love the ambience, and the staff were polite. Just that, if u order food, it can be a tad to long to wait.

No aircond, just fans and ocean breeze. It's so calm and soothing hanfing at your corridor with some coffee.", "I stayed there 3 nights and really enjoyed it. Nice bungalows with ocean views, nice snorkeling and Freddie is really helpful. Freddie cook himself dinner for his guests and every night has a little speech to welcome the new guests and explain the menu.. Nothing around so better to plan to eat in Freddie restaurant. Good food but not amazing. Pulau weh is touristic but remind that we are in Aceh and in order to respect the people here, dress up respectfully..", "Heaven do exist here.

I am totally recommending this stay to anyone who would like to tour in Sabang . Just Absolutely amazing place .", "Freddy brings a new meaning to the word host. He takes hospitality to a whole new level. Freddy goes above and beyond to ensure each guest is welcomed, comfortable and enjoying themselves. This is most evident during the nightly speech (a real highlight of the whole experience), where he addresses everyone personally to welcome them, checks they are ok and ready for the coming day. This is followed by a full weather report, marine report and island report. \u201cIt\u2019s just greeeeat\u201d. The communal buffet dinners are themed with Freddie\u2019s own personal Seth Effrican touch. They are amazing spreads and he caters for even the pickiest eaters. Themed music really sets the tone and you can often see Freddy grooving away to the beat in the kitchen. He is meticulous with organization,", "Freddie is a heartwarming host, who managed to build a magic place at the beach. We loved everything: the seaview bungalows equipped with everything you need in high quality and a hammock at the balcony on top; the food is the best we had in Sumatra, especially Freddies dinner, but also locals like the menue and the restaurant is a common meeting point for young Indonesians; we enjoyed the beach, swimming and snorkeling, although we didn't find the turtle that lives around the swimming platform... But most of all we liked Freddie, who gives love and empathy to everyone of his team, his guests and the locals; who spents a lot of time, money and power to restore the reef and protect the nature; who has warm words, good advices and tipps for everyone to stay comfortable. We need", "We had a wonderfull 2 nights stay at Freddies Bungalows. Nice balcony with view the blue and very clean sea. Nice breakfeast buffet and the dinner buffet with Freedies introduction of the different meals was very great. Price for the meals and the snorchelling masks/floss are more than fair. Freddie and his stuff are very friendly and helpfull. Nice snocrchelling directly in front of the Hotel. For swimming on sand beach just walk 5 minutes to the left side.", "I really love the view from our room although the wind was very strong maybe because we face the open sea. The room was well equipped. It has tissues, electric kettle, glasses, mineral water, clothes hanger, and even safe deposit box! But one thing that i found a little disturbing was there were small bugs. I guess they successfully went to our room because I opened the balcony door the whole afternoon (haha!) and put down the mosquito net too late. So guys, learn from my mistake :D", "Freddies place is a dream coming true. The view from the bungalows is awesome and the beach is wonderful. Freddie is such a great guy and a warm-hearted host. We felt so welcome and everytime we needed something, he and his wonderful team took care of it. The evening dinners are a small sensation as there is a delicious four course meal with influences from different kinds of cuisine all over the world and Freddie will hold a speech at every dinner and asking everyone how their day went. You can see and feel that he really wants his guest to feel comfortable. Thank you Freddie for a great holiday!", "The best thing about freddies is the food. It is always good and great location too with stunning beach.The staff was friendly and accommodating.

We recomend this place to everyone who visit this beautiful island.", "First of all: Freddie is the most dedicated host one could want. Yes, the view is lovely, the staff is friendly, the food is delicious and the underwaterworld beautiful (just grab your snorkelgear, walk to the beach en swim off), but what makes this place really special is Freddie. Everything is been thought of, he arranges trips for you, transfers, tickets for the ferry. He is really connected to his guests. There are two restaurants: one with a daily buffet (upstairs), every day a different theme, e.g. Italian, Arabic or seafood; the other one (downstairs) is a la carte. The restaurants both look down at the beach. The WiFi is quite good. The cabins are clean and have the same nice seaview from the balcony. Provided with a watertank, refrigerator and a fan.

We got room 1, a bungalow with a beautiful view in the beach and ocean (including sunrise!). Own bathroom with cold and hot water, fridge, water tank, coffee/tea facilities and a balcony with hammock. In the restaurant you have a great choice of food a la carte or you can choose for the buffet for breakfast and/or dinner. The buffet food changes every day and is good quality. From the restaurant you can watch the sea. If you like pizza you can go to Casanemo, 5 minutes walk along the beach. Freddie himself is a very nice man who gives a sort of speech every evening and is always in for a talk. So far the good things. Now some things we didn't like so much: Room 1 was just 5 meters from the speakers from a mosque so in the early evening", "Freddie and his staff will give you the perfect way to enjoy your holiday.

I don't want to spoil the surprise for future guests, but all I will say is make sure you reserve a place for a buffet dinner on at least 1 of your nights. Not only is Freddie extremely personable and caring, he is an EXCELLENT chef which is a complete bonus! We never expected to have such good food whilst staying on Sabang.

Apparently it is everything it could offered. I was on a business trip to Aceh, then I plan a quick get away to Sabang, and book this place. The place was around 20 minute from the harbor which took me from Aceh to Sabang. It's a small road, I literally need to walk a bit, then once arrived in there, I need to take the stairs down to receptionist, which is where the restaurant also located. A quick re-registration, then I walk through another stairs, to my humble cute little cottage, it has a porch and directly face the beach, with palm trees everywhere.

They can organise everything from tuktuk drivers, to snorkelling tours and massages and more. Nothing is too much effort. Freddies culinary skills are something to look forward to each evening with variety & flavours. The rooms are clean, tidy and with the most amazing views.

After a week traveling around the mainland, Freddies was a real safe haven away from the restrictions of the province. More importantly, Freddie is a superb welcoming host, making you feel at home the moment you arrive. He knows each one of the guests by name, checks on you every day to make sure everything is fine, and prepares and presents his food with real care. He even helped me out when I got really sick! A great place to rest and relax", "Freddies has got to be the best place on the Island. Freddies will organize everything from scooters, snorkling, diving, fishing trips, ferry tickets etc. Some of the best snorkeling is only a few meters away. Very safe and the water was so clear. I cut my foot and the staff were more than happy to help. They put sap from a tree on it and this cleared it up and no scar. Amazing. The food was awesome. Pizza especially. Best Ive had. Prices were good. Most nights they put on a theme night..Italian food traditional indonesian etc 4 course meal. Well worth it.

You can also arrange a tour with ifan. Really recommendable.", "Great location in Sabang, accessible through rental car. The sea view is very nice, just open your balcony to feel the cool wind. The food in the cafe also great, we had 2 times of breakfast buffet, really worth it. Having some coffee with great friends and nice view. Fully recommended!", "I think Freddies has the best location in the entire island of Weh. It is located on the best beach in the island, which is Sumur Tiga Beach. As it's name 'Freddies Santai' (santai means relax), it has relax and soothing atmosphere. All rooms have sea view, and the restaurant also. Although the rooms have no air-con, you still can get sea breeze everytime you open the window. The in-room amenities is quite complete. They provides towel, refrigerator, water heater, drinking water, hammock, even an umbrella and a prayer mat! The food in the restaurant is also good and affordable. Best place for hangout with your friends, or just having your time alone while reading books. The staffs are nice, and will be happy to help us.", "I stayed in Freddies for 4 nights in May 2017. It was a smooth experience right from the booking, as Freddie responds to email swiftly. I was able to arrange for pickup & dinner arrangement even before I arrived at the island. He also knows a bunch of good local guides for island tours, snorkeling, and diving trips. The bungalow was clean and comfortable. It was located right by the beach so I could hear the waves relaxing me to sleep. Despite the authentic island vibe, one could still enjoy the modern comfort - the water heater worked every time; and strong, reliable WiFi was available in every room. I do hope they get new bedsheets though - the ones I had was a bit worn. On food: Freddies & team serve tasty breakfasts & dinners. I love the little chit-chat & weather updates", "Very recommend place to visit in summer time, u can bring ur family, friends & ur couple. The view from the bungalow is very beautiful, the room is also clean. They have a restaurant with sea view and also delicious food. I love the way they treat us, it's like ur in ur home because the staff very friendly. U can read the book in their library.", "We stay 7 nights, service is ok for what we spent. Quite cheap compared with what we get. Ocean view from the height of the cliff. Good food. The minor things are no air con, some area mixed w/ public, too small bathroom (bungalow) and local pray at the early morning.", "Our return to Freddie's was inevitable. We came on the anniversary of our first trip because we had such an amazing time the first time around. The beach, the water and the food are impeccable. This spot is run by some of the most genuinely helpful folks, including Freddie whom we didn't see much of on this trip unfortunately, but who made sure that our arrival and departure were seamless from the moment we landed in Banda Aceh.", "Based on my experience there in MID JANUARY this year, this place is not suitable for those who seeks more than just pretty resort. Yes,the resort is nice. I like the rustic design. The sea view is to die for. However, during my stay I can barely able to enjoy the beach as the wave was very strong/high. And it is not safe to swim. Dont get mw wrong, the beach here (sumur tiga) is one of the nicest within the locality. And during the night there is nothing u can do. Its damn boring. The foods are quite expensive compared to other restaurants I went. The wifi is damn slow it cant compensate the boredom of the night. Haha. I wouldnt want to stay here if I happen to visit pulau weh in the future.", "Travelled with 4 friends, booked a 6 people room. Amazing view from the balcony. No aircon but mosquito netting provided - and with the price you paid, not complaining. Food was okay. Just here for the view! The toilet was a lil smelly but we were out most of the time and just spent a night here. Not a big issue.", "this hotel is not only nice but the owner is so friendly. every night enjoyed food from their kitchen and cost really affordable. room view was superb really suite for those in honeymoon. beach is really nice to swim. room are huge to accomodate 5 people. water pressure also no complaint.", "We stayed here for 2 nights. Nice wooden bungalows with breathtaking view from balcony. Our room facing the sea. The food was fantastic. Marinara Pizza is highly recommended!!! Freddie is very kind and all the staff are so very friendly and helpful. Good beach, good food and good people. Everything was perfect!! We really enjoyed our stay!!", "Freddie and his staff did a fantastic job throughout our stay. Evening dinners were enjoyable as Freddie would ask how everyone was doing which made it very easy to start talking to other people staying there. Being on the beach made it extremely easy to relax and my children had a great time too. All in all a family holiday to remember.", "Resort with private beach..love the sunrise from my room...delicious food and warm hospitality from the staff and Mr Freddie the owner of the resort..very close to the ferry port approximately 15 minutes by car..will surely stay here again very soon..", "If you're coming to Sabang, then Freddies is a must. One of the best accommodation on the island. Room itself has some fine sea view, all ameninites you would need are also provided. Downside is that it's quite noisy around midnight as the room itself doesn't block sound well. Besides that, the beach is easily accessed and magnificent at its finest. Freddies also provides you with optional dinner and breakfast, which I have only one word for it, delicious. Freddies himself is a very helpful and easily approachable. 8.5/10", "Travel with group of friend. I think every local knew the hotel. The room is clean enough, like expected. Maybe the minus is the linen already spotted and old, not really comfort. Found some unexpected guest at night (insect like big ants, spider, or even crab). The cottage located exactly beside the beach, can go to the beach anytime we want. We can see lot of colorful fish even just snorkeling not far from shoreline. Restaurant service really slow, must wait for about 30 min. My advice is bring some snack while waiting for food.", "I love staying at Freddies so so much I wish i could stay longer. No doubt this hotel has the BEST (i really mean it! Haha) view through the window beside your bed and i dont have anything to complaint about this hotel. Everything is there, even the mosquito spray and air freshener. The room and the toilet are clean as well. So whats not to love about Freddie's Hotel? ;D", "We stayed at Freddies for 5 days and didn't actually leave the hotel for the entire time. Our room was clean and spacious, the beach was pristine, even nice snorkeling. food-processinThe best bit was the food!", "i love my 2 nights stay at this place. simple room but with a spectacular view. the room was spacious with basic amenities, but it ok. breakfast n dinner available at the cafe. the pizza there is a must try menu. i will definitely visit again someday.", "I loved my stay here. Freddie is awesome and really takes amazing care of his guests. Spectacular location right on the most pristine beach. Paradise. Simple rooms all with million dollar views. Very basic amenities. Could do with a softer mattress and another fan but all in all, a great location. Breakfast and dinner are like a family affair. All guests gather in the main dining and Freddie gives a little talk about each menu of which he and his staff have prepared. Then its help yourself. You will never go hungry and the food is great. There is only ONE bad thing about this hotel. You will never get ANY sleep between 5am and 8 am due to the loud speakers from the neighbor being only 4 ft from your bedroom blasting the \"call to prayer\". By the end of a", "This hotel serves you the best view to the long beach shore, best sunrise. Many tourists from KL cos they had a direct plane from KL. If you try to swim at the beach be careful of tide waves and deep sea", "I love Freddies Santai, such a wonderful place and it is secluded. My style of location to relax and unwind. Freddie is such a lovely host, he will take care of you, no need to worry about anything. The property itself is charming, set of traditional indonesian huts facing the blue sea. I have no complaints for Freddie. Truly amazing place. I will definitely visit again", "We had a great stay at Freddies at Santai Sumur Tiga. Ist a Special place here..... The view is amazing here. When i come back to Pulau Weh, then i will stay here again. The ffod here is also very yummy. Freddie offers every evening a yummy menu. Thank you very much.", "I like how the room were, with bamboo wall (*insert Earl Grant's song here) traditional look and feel. The location is just by the beach, the water is clear - the only minus was the rock/corals along the beach line. The room is clean and nice - but for Indonesian who has been pampered with AC all their life, this is not the accommodation for you. My family has been complaining on how they could not sleep due to the heat (I slept just well) and sweating all night. Since the location is much secluded, If you do not rent a car you could dine in, they have a la carte and buffet option.", "Freddies was an Oasis. Freddie himself was the perfect host who put in the extra effort. The evening Buffets and the breakfasts were amazing and vaue for money. The shower was powerful and hot. The beach was perfect with crystal clear water and great snorkeling with a platform to swim out to. It was all in all perfect and could not be faulted in anyway. We wish we could we had stayed longer.", "Freddies is a very welcoming place. The owner could not do enough to make my stay comfortable. The Bisto evening meal is a very social affair,and the food is excellent. I would recommend Freddies for a great base from which to explore this lovely island.", "Our stay at freddies was definately the best thing we could do on pulau weh. Freddi is very friendly and helps you with everything! His food is delicious! It feels very familiar. The bungalows have a great view and you can snorkel on the beach directly. For the way back, freddi organized our transfer, everything was fine, but we didnt know there is a slower and cheaper ferry, which we would take next time.", "Three nights was not enough. Beautiful views, good cabins with balconies, excellent food and cameraderie. Freddie is an excellent host. Small beach, rocky at low tide. Good base for exploring the Island. Staff provide all the local travel advice you need and help with ongoing reservations.", "Stayed for 3 nights. Rates were reasonable. The staff were very friendly and helpful especially Freddie who was a delight. The room was clean and cozy with a nice view. We enjoyed dinner very much! Would definitely stay here again.", "Good food, beautiful place, friendly staff. If you staying here you must at least try their buffet dinner once. Love the menu choice and how the boss explain the menu and give us friendly welcome. kinda disturbed with a lot of noise early morning (rooster crows) and someone put a speaker while prayer makes us wake up early haha. beside that all was fine and wonderful", "Dear Freddie! we thank you again a thousand times for the perfect vacation we expierienced in your place. you are the friendliest person ever!!! the bungalow was great, with a perfect view of the beach and the ocean, the dinners were always so special and good, i hope to visit again one day.", "We loooved our stay at Freddie's. This place is amazing. We had a bungalow with balcony and ocean view and could hang our hammock. Good place for snorkeling, located directly at the beach with white sand, turquoise water and palms. Freddie prepares different dinner buffets each night. He introduces his guests and the food which is delicious. You get soup, appetizer, buffet with at least 10 different dishes and desert. He surprised us each night with different dishes from around the world with family atmosphere. Wish we could have taken Freddie, his place and the crew with us when we left. This is a great place. Breakfast buffet is also very good. Don't know how he does it with these affordable prices.", "We stayed in the family room. The room was clean and tidy. The service was fantastic and the owner was super friendly. Would love to come back and spend my holiday there. The private beach was lovely but just have to be careful with the rocks - scratched my foot a couple times. The only downside is the parking area from the resort is a bit of a walk. But other than that I would recommend it.", "I arrived at Freddies with my parents and stayed there just for one night. our room is facing the sea which was great and the room was clean. The only think they could do better is that not allowing people to smoke anywhere they like especially in the restaurant because some people cannot stand the smoke and it spoils the nice breeze. So far we had a good time", "As my first solo trip in SEA, Freddies has left me wanting more, to explore places just like this. Freddy and his staff takes every effort to ensure every guest has an enjoyable stay throughout. I initially booked just three nights and extended for another two just because this place is pure paradise. I do not dive nor snorkel. For 5 days, it was spent with a book in my room directly facing the sea, on the hammock in my balcony, at the restaurant or on the beach. I took a day tour to visit other places on the island like Gapang and Iboih and nothing beats the place at Freddies with the private beach. Some days, I have the beach all to myself. What i appreciated most staying at Freddies was participating in the buffet dinner. Before the commencement of dinner, Freddy would ask", "If you are looking for a relaxing getaway, go for it. As was described in previous evaluation, this is a perfect place. Freddie is really a special person, who cares so much. We went every evening for his diner, which was always great and you see how much he cares if you like it. Freddie organized for us one day snorkeling trip (the guy was really good, we have enjoyed it so much) . If Freddie is not present, it is obviously not running as smoothly as when he is there, but we were fine with it (the room was not cleaned only once in the whole week, guess what day it was... :o) Freddies colleague booked for us a car for half day and it wasn\u00b4t as great as the driver didn\u00b4t speak ANY english, so when we asked him to take us to the fish market, he just didnt understand and was", "One thing that I remember the most about staying at Freddies is the super windy breeze and the food! Room: We slept with the window open (we stayed in the sea facing room. Room no.4) for the 2 nights stay. The sound of the strong wind and ocean wave actually did sound scary that I found it quite hard to fall asleep in the first night but on the 2nd night we get used to it already. The room is enough for 3 people. There's a queen bed and a single bed. U have to climb a small mini stairs to get to the toilet/shower room which we found quite weird in the beginning as the toilet is higher than the bedroom. Anyway, its clean and fully equipped with everything. There's a mini fridge in the room. No telephone is provided in the room to make a call to the receptionist. I guess maybe", "Great location, friendly staff and Freddie is an excelent cook. The family approach was a nice bonus that made us feel really relaxed. The beach and marine life just in front of the hotel are exactly what people want on a location like this,", "good location close to airport and harbour as well as to the city of sabang, cozy huts with balcony, fridge and safety box, friendly staff, everything was well organized like transport, bike rental and ferry tickets...we had a very pleasant stay, thanks to freddie and his team", "It has been both a pleasure and a privilege to be at Freddie's for 12 days. In addition to a prime location on a beautiful island, there is a wonderful feeling here. Freddie has created an environment which includes and connects people from around the world. He also extends a sincere welcome to locals -- bringing an authentic vibe to his establishment. The food is amazing, and the staff shows the same great respect to guests as Freddie shows to them. As an added bonus ---- there are no mosquitos!!", "We came with family of five and stayed 3 nights instead of the intended 5. Freddie is a great host trying his best to please everybody. His menus and quality cooking at dinner time with explanation speeches are singular and unique. We slept in one of the rooms close to the beach with bunkbeds for the children which they loved. For the children Freddie also had some games available to play which is a nice touch and reminds me of my back packer times. This place though already operating since 2005 still breaths pioneering air and not really a good place for young children (ours are 14,12,7). There is no room to play outside and the beach was swept away by rough weather and only rocks remained. There was a place 100 meters away, but you have to go over the rocks to get there.Please", "I love staying at Freddie, eventhough when e get there the weather was not freindly.lets talk about food !!! Freddie's cook by himself ad taste really good with so many various meal and with his warm personality makes me feels like home, and the guests treated like a family :D For activities, snorkling package with recommended guide, contact Andy +6285276449599 he knows beautiful spots for snorkle and he speaks English very good too. I also asked him to explore the island on motorbike for one day trip with very reasonable price. If I may give a suggestion, Freddie's need to pay attention on the cleaness of their bedsheet ( I do not say it is dirty but better to change to other color rather than white, easy to spot stain ) and check cover on bathroom so dry leaves not flying", "Missing the little piece of paradise at Freddie's already! Even though weather wasn't at its best, Freddie's warm personality, great organization and superb culinary skill more than made up for it. View of the ocean is also fabulous from bungalow 9, waters are as in the pictures when the sun finally came out - shades of sparkling clear turquoise #nofilter We did a snorkeling trip with an experienced guide, Andy... highly recommended! Saw a myriad of marine life including rays, scorpion fish, clown fish, octopus and many many more. Hope to be back soon, take care Freddie! :)", "We arrived on sunday morning and head straight to Freddie santai sumurtiga. We stayed 2 nights, We were upgraded to apartment due to stair issue. Staff are friendly..and Freddie personally cook dinner for the guests.....you will love the place but if you have knee problem, you may have to reconsider. other than that fantastic. We missed Freddie's cook already the next day we left for Banda Aceh and tried Freddies Pizza....to our surprise...food for 10pax 2 freddies is cheaper than nasi ayam paramugari.....", "-Nice place to stay, value for money, family rooms provide bunk bed.. my kids really love it. -Nice sunrise view from balcony -friendly staff -No air-conditioner but windy and airy -clean room and well maintained", "We had a great time at Freddies: He is a very warm, welcoming and caring host! The food is amazing and his speeches are just great! All staff is very friendly and caring, rooms have a stunning view and are cleaned every day. Did I already say, that the food is amazing? Thanks for everything! We hope, we can come back some time!", "We had a great stay at Freddies. We already loved Freddie before we even met him, he helped us booking our tickets with Susi Air while we were still in Belgium. Great food, loved the royal breakfasts and buffets. Very helpfull staff. We stayed 4 nights and never got to meet Freddie himself since he was on a trip, but loved our stay anyway. We would definitely go back to this place. PS: one night we went out for dinner to nearby Casa Nemo, but didn't like the food nor the atmosphere...", "Amazing Place, awesome place, friendly staff and kins. Really really like this hotel. We booking the family room suitable for 5pax. everthings is working well and the best things u can see the beach in your room. Highly recommended. Superhb", "It was a short weekend get-away with close friends whom are first timer to Banda Aceh. As for me I have been to Sabang before but for day trip only, the local people says that it was a relaxing place to spend the weekend. And yes indeed, it was too peaceful with lots of hawkers food to feed our hungry tummy. The resort was just ok nothing to shout about, same goes to the beach but we did enjoy yourself lazing around and did nothing. We rent motorbikes to move around which was hilarious & fun. We spent 2 nights there than we left to Banda Aceh. We stayed a night in Hotel Medan Banda Aceh and during the day we visited the Tsunami affected area, the Baiturrahman Grand mosque which is still under renovation and some shopping at Pasar Aceh. Please be in mind there are no night", "I didn't stay here but wanted to have a little taste for the restaurant... and honestly it was a better experience than what I had in Casanemo. Tho I love Casanemo's rooms more since I can see that Freddies' rooms are too cramped and not as beautiful as Casanemo's. The restaurant was a kick, everything we ordered came in great servings and met our expectations. Delicious for our local Indonesian tongues. But since we're Indonesian... they wouldn't serve us alcoholic beverages. Ugh. Unfair. They could just asked for ID card to see that we're Christians and old enough to drink.", "Amazing place. Awesome food. Friendly, kind. Take care of everything. Great communication to book the hotel. The beach is clean. Silent place to sleep in peace. Beautiful view. And the part I love this place, the owner is the chef. Great", "Awesome. Food, snorkeling, beach, sun all of it was awesome 5 stars for everything. If I had to complain about something, it would be that the room leaked a bit when it was raining heavily, but not on the bed and we were outside whenever we weren't sleeping. Thanks to Freddie and his crew for making it even more awesome. Such a great place", "We liked it so much at Freddie's we rebooked for a fortnight later. We experienced a few of the rooms as a result, the ones to the left of the restaurant are quieter, as the ones on the right get the full force of the 5am call to prayer each morning. But that's a small price to pay for a great little spot, on a lovely sandy beach, with some good snorkelling just a few metres out to sea. Other than the stunning setting undoubtedly the highlight of this place is Freddie himself. A more accommodating host you'd be pushed to find. Nothing is too much trouble, transfers to and from boats and airports happen seamlessly. His evening buffet menu's are well thought out and delicious. We were there for 11 nights in total and didn't have the same menu twice, he makes great use of", "Thank you for the Birthday cake Dad ! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb \u2022 the greeting is so nice \u2022 good services \u2022 warm \u2022 i feel like staying at my own home \u2022 good taste of food \u2022 friendly \u2022 \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc views \u2022 affordable price \u2022 the room is clean \u2022 cozy \u2022 near airport Definitely will come back.", "Freddie is really a nice host. Same goes to all of his staff. When we arrived at Balohan Port, he sent someone to pick us up straight to the chalet. Our room is above the restaurant and the view from our balcony is AMAZING! I think all room have a sea view. The food was delicious. You can swim/snorkel in front of the chalet. They'll provide the equipment. This place is sooo peaceful and i really love to stay here. I definitely will come back!", "We spent 8 nights at Freddies and very much enjoyed our stay. Our room was a decent size and very clean. We had two big single beds pushed together which was not very comfortable but they were swapped out on our last night and replaced with a brand new king bed and matrass. The deck had great sea views but could have done with more comfortable seating. The room itself was well set up with water cooler, fridge and jug. The dinner buffet was great value at 65,000rp with plenty of options and of a good standard. The downstairs restaurant was well priced and also did some decent food especially the chicken curry. Snorkeling of the beach was very good with plenty of different species of fish. We also did a snorkeling trip through Freddies and it was excellent, probably the best we", "the place to stay in Pulau Weh. Freddie is the most genuine host we ever experienced and all-rounder, anything you need Freddie will arrange it, from pick up at the airport, transport to the ferry and pick up on the other site to the hotel. food is mouth watering and every night a new surprise is on the menu. we couldn't have asked for more and will come back.", "Just visit here if you're heading to Pulau Weh. Freddie is one of the most wonderful hotel managers I've ever come across, creating a warm and friendly atmosphere and serving up INCREDIBLE FOOD. Amazing service, lovely staff, gorgeous location and great dive centers nearby. In room (bunglow) amenities include hot showers, water dispensers, tea and coffee making facilities, fan and a safe. Just go there! :)", "Been here numerous times and love it. Freddie's a master chef, creating a warm relaxing atmosphere in an unbeatable stretch of beach. Bungalows cling to the side of the cliff- every room has beach front view and balcony. Room 7 is my favorite- private balcony. There is hot shower, refrigerator & water dispenser. Don't miss this gem!!", "Where do we start with Freddies? Arriving at these wonderful bungalows after the long trip it took to get to Pulau Weh was just heaven. Freddie's is tucked away from the main road, and when you come around the corner to see the wonderful bungalows built into the cliffside and that incredible view, you know you won't want to leave. From our initial contact, Freddie was so accommodating and helpful. We hadn't booked ahead yet he managed to find a room for us for three nights and also provided a nights stay in his overflow rooms as we didn't want to leave. The rooms are so well equipped, with bedding and towels and tissues, coffee and tea making facilities, drinking water, refrigerator, safe, ample power points - there's nothing he hasn't thought of in these rooms. The bungalows", "So the positives first - Freddie is good warm host, buffet dinner every night serves interesting and not always Asian food, which was refreshing after travelling through Sumatra, he also makes an entertaining speech, welcoming guests, it's quite serious but that's why it's fun to watch, good choice of spirits, and staff are friendly although English is not as good as other places we stayed on Sumatra. The place is stunning I n terms of location, beautiful beach, warm water and they arranged snorkelling trip which was brilliant. The rooms are right on water, you can hear the waves crashing, very easy to relax the negatives, well the call to prayer at 5am is so loud, makes sleeping tricky in morning, also Freddie claims no Mosquitos but we did get bitten so I'm not sure why he", "We were lucky enough to stay here for 5 nights. After staying at Freddies and seeing other locations around the island, I have no doubt we picked the best spot. The beach and views are fantastic. We stayed in a family bungalow which is great value for money. Very basic but comfortable accommodation, our room was a bit crowded but we only used it to sleep in anyway. All rooms have fantastic views and balconies. The food was sooo good, the one night we didn't eat here we regretted it. Usually we like to try different types of eating places when we travel - but if you stay here you will know what I mean. Freddie organises a different theme each night which includes a soup, starter, buffet style for mains then a dessert. This arrangement with the food is also fantastic value", "I had the pleasure of staying 2 nights at Freddie's was on my weekend off and all I wanted was to relax ... the rooms are comfy and clean , hot shower, fan, they all have mosquito nets and most of all they all have this amazing sea view :) and you have a private beach right in front of the hotel... Freddie is a wonderful host who cooked this yummy buffet dinner and breakfast everyday ... The staff were all very helpful and nice. What else can I say , just had an perfect relaxed weekend in sabang ... Thanks Freddie :)", "i stayed a week at Freddie's in July. Among the great things i can say about the place, Freddie as a host is the best feature. He welcomes you as an old friend, and before he announces what food will be served at the buffet that day, he welcomes and introduces each new guest. Speaking about the buffet, i joined it every night because the food is so amazing. There is a different theme every day and is is all fresh, healthy and super tasty. The rooms are simple, made a natural materials and the view from your balcony is stunning. They are cleaned daily and mine was spotless. The beach in front is not too big, but very clean and you can snorkel right in front. Freddie is very helpful in arranging trips, booking ferry ticket, massage etc. I can highly recommend a stay and hope to", "Freddie's is the best place on Pulau Weh I've seen so far. Best value for money, spacious clean and comfortable bungalows with stunning views over the beach and the ocean, the buffet dinner is outstanding, even if you are vegetarian. Freddie loves to cook and that is what you taste when you eat his food. On the beach you don't feel strange as a tourist wearing a bathing suit or bikini. In Iboih, the touristic center of Pulau Weh (which is still not crowded at all), the situation is less relaxed for foreigners, and the beach in front of Freddie's is more beautiful anyway. For the low budget backpacking tourists Iboih might be the right choice but if you love to have a quiet stressless comfortable and nice stay on the island with good food and even a choice of alcoholic beverages", "Great atmosphere, exclusive beautiful beach, superfood and low prices, great snorkling and sunlocation. The host, Freddie does everything to please his clients. Freddies = hidden paradise = must done!", "Freddies is a really peaceful place - perfect after exhausting traveling around the island of Sumatra! Its not really touristic area there, but if you wanna explore the island just hire a scooter..The owner Freddie is a nice guy and makes you feel very welcome at his place! We stayed for 4 days in different Bungalows (didnt prebooked but freedie did everything to get us a place to stay - thanks freddie!), all of them were clean with a nice oceanview, comfy beds and everything you needed. The food is good as well especially freddies buffet dinner, which offers every night different food and I have to say you get a lot for what you pay!", "Spent 4 days at Freddies during a month long summer exchange in Banda Aceh. Freddies was just what we had read here and more! The bungalows were simple and nice, amazing beach and the staff helpful and nice. Freddy himself takes good care of the customers and makes sure everybody has fun. The dinner buffet at the hotel in the evening is sooooo good, really wanted to bring some recipes home! Would recommend it to friends and family!", "Great view.. like in the pictures here..! My parents, my 2 kids and I stay here for 1 night only..on 28 May 2015. Great seaview. Clean and comfortable. Good wifi. Not luxury, just very practical and has all basic needs. Staffs are kind and helpful. Freddies pizza and marinara pizza are very delicious. We will definitely wanna come again..! Beautiful and calm..", "The service provided by Freddie and other staff was outstanding. They are very friendly too! You don't have to worry about your transportation at Pulau Weh as you can ask Freddie to arrange it. Freddie and the staff also cook good food. You'll regret it if you don't try the buffet breakfast and dinner. You will love the heat and the scene of the sunrise as you enjoy the breakfast. The main attraction is the beautiful beach. If youre looking for peaceful place to stay, Freddie's is the answer. The only setback is that the room was quite hot as there was only one small fan. WiFi service was available for free. I will come back soon to enjoy the beautiful scenery!", "Long way from the port to Freddies didn't turn us down as we saw this Inn entirely entitled with its beautiful view and cozy place. Hidden from the main road, as if you need to discover your own nest to stay. The main restaurant was gorgeous as we could feel the sunrise's heat through our skin. Below the main one,you could find another restaurant belongs to the same proprietaire, yet the service was entirely different from the main restaurant. This 'first floor' restaurant could not respond to the need of clients since they were unorganized. Several orders were abandoned, until we asked them for our orders. Too bad for this. A part from that, the in-house service was nice, the hotel staffs were full of hospitality and humorous. And as for the view and the rhythm", "Starting from booking up to our leaving, the service was excellent! Freddie as the owner really knows how to spoil his guest. The room location was nothing but perfection, in front of a white sand beach where you can just run down and feel the warm water by walking distance. Food was great, must reserve yourself for their buffet dinner. Tasty yet very affordable. We were gonna give a five star but the restaurant sometimes forget our order (twice) and we had to remind them again even though it was written on menu order paper. But the rest of the service is nothing but excellent! The room was clean and has a hot and cold water, tea and drinking water and also a free WiFi. Definitely will come here again :)", "We stayed at Freddies late March, and were a little unsure what to expect if I'm being honest. Before the stay, Freddie was very quick to reply to email enquiries and despite the reviewer below suggesting otherwise, there really is no way you would misunderstand what is and isn't included. The room was basic but charming and absolutely adequate for most peoples' needs with a view to die for. Wifi wasn't generally available at the end of the resort we stayed in, but I'm on holiday, that's no big deal. Living in the middle-east, we are used to the call to prayer so generally slept through it in the morning, although I can imagine this would be annoying to others - but it's a muslim country, if you don't like it, don't travel to muslim countries! We spent 7 days at Freddies,", "I came here actuallu for business reason, but I came earlier to visit Sabang. I didn't realize that's a long weekend, so it's very difficult to find place to stay. But Freddie is really helpful. He responded very fast to my email. First, his place was full, but in the day I fly to Banda Aceh, he said 1 person is cancelled, then I can stay there! Hurray! I like the room, they don't hv an AC but I didn't feel hot when I was sleeping. The view from the bungalow was very stunning! Blue, green, tosca water. My gosh! And for only 65K dinner, i got completely dinner started from appetizers to desert. Tasted very berry good! Not forget to mention that I love Freddie. He's friendly and lovable! Nice! Thanks a lot Freddy!", "We didn't book in advance but Freddie managed to accomodate us despite being very busy and booked up. Really Sumur Tiga is a beautiful place, but the atmosphere and touch of Freddie, his amazing buffet dinner...just make the experience unique! Freddie can also book you a flight from Sabang in case you want, it was really convenient for us. Breakfast is buffett and the choice is one you'll never find anywhere else in Pulau Weh. Freddie also welcome you and take care of you in a discrete caring way...what more can you ask? I loved the food, the decor of the deck, our bungalow with stunning beach view, the service...all was perfect!", "Freddies place is a hidden gem in sabang's magnificent scenery. The rooms are perfect, they provided us with basic amenities, although they could use a bigger blanket. We slept in the bungalows, the view is perfect, with a hammock provided in the balcony. And you should try their coffee, it's a really unique blend betaeen gayo and ulee coffee. Access is not that easy, around 10 kms from the port, but every driver in the port should know their place. It is very near to the beach, with a magnificent view of sunrise. The upstairs and downstairs cafe is equally has good quality. We tried the dinner buffet in the upstairs cafe and it is really unique, with freddy explaining each and every menu. The dowstairs cafe has Indonesian chef, i recommend trying the chicken curry, the best", "All the rooms in Freddies have the sea view. I got the family rooms above the restaurant, since all the bungalows were full at that time. The room has nice bamboo wall, traditional handicraft, clean bathroom + hot/cold water, complimentaries (tea, coffee, water), kettle, referigerator, fan, balcony direct view to the sea. Although the hotel pictures is not very good on the website, it is a great eco hotel for the real. No AC? Dont worry, since it faces directly to the sea, the wind keeps cool air. Dont forget to enjoy your Sumurtiga beach time, it's already in Freddies.", "Came here for lunch at their beachfront Restaurant (cliff side more like) and wasn't that impressed. Actually the La Piazza/Freddies resto combo back in the city (Banda Aceh) was way better (menu and food). The whole place looks like it is way past it's prime; perhaps great at one time but currently in the process of a makeover/renovation. The Food was just Okay, the staff were very friendly. The Beach is good for snorkle mask diving but it's full of coral and rocks so be carefull stepping (or bring diving boots to protect your feet). The beachfront in front of freddies is full of tiny litter (and it's not maintained or combed). Could definately use improvement; won't be back. Happy we booked at The Pade Dive resort hotel on the other side which was way more serene and", "Stayed on March 10, 2015, with two friends and we took up the family room which is just above the reception cum restaurant area. The view from our room was gorgeous and the room was huge with more beds than we could sleep in. The toilet was excellent and big, with everything working fine. My friend was surprised that the seawater at beach in front of this place was not that salty and your skin won't feel so sticky after a dip into the sea. In fact he decided there is no need to take a shower after swimming in the sea when we go out for dinner. As for me I was mesmerised that the seawater was so crystal clear and calm that I could see the fingers of my foot stepping on the sands below. There are plenty of beautiful corals to see just a short swim from the beach and lots of", "We stayed four nights in Freddie's and had a great time. The rooms are basic beach bungalows but they are very clean and including a western toilet, a fridge and free water/tea/coffee. The view from the balconies of the bungalows is amazing! Just perfect, it was so nice to relax in the hammock and watch the sea... The whole bungalow complex is ok but not really a beauty. Open white lights, no decoration at all. This is something that Freddie's neighbour 'Cassa Nemo' can do definitely better. But the view is stunning as mentioned already earlier and the beach is quite nice as well. Sadly next to the bungalow complex there is a lot of rubbish around. If I would be the owner of the resort, I would ask my staff to pick up the rubish at least once a week. The famous dinner buffet", "Did not stay here as it was fully booked, but then again maybe it was a blessing because the entire place looks quite rundown n needs a major makeover. Came over for lunch one day after reading about all the good reviews on their food, but frankly speaking was a bit surprised on why they are so highly recommended. The restaurant doesn't look clean, lots of flies everywhere(even inside the kitchen where you can see them preparing your food n drinks), furnitures and flooring looks old. Waited 45minutes for our pizza even though there were no other customers, and the taste was nothing to shout about at all. Had better ones a stone's throw away. JUST commenting on their food n restaurant to be fair as i did not experienced the accommodation.", "Had the absolute pleasure of staying at Freddies in Feb 2015 and it was absolutely fantastic. Freddie is an absolute gent, and employs the most friendly, attentive local staff. Prior to arrival Freddie was extremely helpful in providing information about ferry's, island activities etc and made the whole process smooth and enjoyable. My 7 night stay seemed to fly by, doing various activities around the island organised by Freddie and then returning home to wonderful food each evening!! Cannot wait to return later in the year!!", "Perfect location to stay right on the beach, perfect meals cooked by mr. Freddie and his staff everynight a 4 cours meal! We really enjoyed even when everything was fully booked. A friend of us recommended this place and we just fully agree you must stay here, there is no better place for eating and sleeping together at one place.", "It's not easy to explaining how wonderful Freddie and his place are. You could use every synonym for BRILLIANT. We had such a good time here and it was the best place we've been after 3 months of travelling. Freddie is so nice and helpful and always there for you if you need anything. And his food is so unbelievable good, can't find any words for it. Being in Pulau Weh and not staying at Freddie's is a huge mistake. We just loved it.", "We came here because everything we read about Freddie's sounded perfect - rustic but clean, private bungalow with deck and hammock suspended only maybe fifty meters from where the waves break on the beach, home cooked meals every night, friendly, knowledgeable people to help you get around, and great atmosphere. But the most convincing line of any review is always \" I came for a week and stayed for much longer\" or \" I never wanted to leave.\" Well, we have only been here two nights, and we are leaving with great reluctance, because we have fixed plans in place elsewhere, but are already making plans to return. We called it a bit if a Robinson Crusoe experience, lying in the hammock strung across the deck, overlooking the ocean waves loudly crashing below, wind blowing through", "Folks this is Indonesia frontier out of the way sort of place... if you are looking for club med go to Phuket instead! If you are looking for undiscovered memorable place that is not developed with friendly people and a simple tropical paradise then yes this is the place! Freddie is amazing. Ifan his transfer driver in Bandah Aceh is also amazing! Simple, clean beach side resort with the most amazing breakfasts and dinners. OK, sorry I am over using the word \"amazing\" maybe I should say really super incredible!!!!! The room had a mini fridge, kettle, water cooler, ample space for clothes and gear, and a hammock, two chairs and a small table on the balcony. Freddie has thought of everything you could possible need in the beach side cabana. There was even insect spray and", "If I could summarize our advice in three words and five exclamation points it would be: \"Stay at Freddies!!!!!\" What makes Freddies one of the most unique and best places we have stayed in Indonesia is Freddie (sp?) himself. Freddie personally works really hard to make sure the needs of all of his guests are met and that everyone is enjoying themselves. Freddie arranged much of the logistics of our trip (airport pickup, hotel in Banda Aceh, ferry tickets, etc.) so that we didn't have to, which made the trip much more relaxing for us. One of the best and most unique things about staying at Freddies are the home cooked dinner \"buffets\", which consist of two appetizers, a variety of entrees (Indonesian, Western, South African, etc....) and dessert all planned and cooked by", "Freddies is utter bliss. From the moment you walk down the path and get your first breathtaking view of the ocean, to the second Freddy bids you farewell. Not only is this place blessed with the most incredible natural environment (I spent hours every day just watching that Aqua ocean!) but the service here is amazing. Friendly, professional, personal and the staff are all extremely welcoming and hard working. Ask and they will help in any way. My bungalow was exquisite and cleaned daily. And the food! I have not eaten that well in years. I am vegetarian and travelled with a vegan - no problem for freddy he will go out of his way to ensure there is a huge variety of delicious food. I stayed here for 10 nights and every meal was different, varied and tasted amazing. The special", "we spend several days at Freddie bungalow and we enjoy The calm and The beach...the easy and friendly stuff make our stay great...Freddie multiple talents are helpful in many way but the one we really enjoy was the food he cook...a great place for a time off in a beautiful island...", "We stayed with Freddie for a number of nights and I could not believe how wonderful it was. The bedroom was quaint but cozy, but we were there for the beach. He has a very nice beach out front and it was so easy to go out for a swim or walk along the beach. In our bungalow there was a refrigerator; fresh tank of drinking water; tea and coffee with a water heater; a lovely bed; night stands; and a large bookcase for clothes or other things. I felt much more comfortable with his built in wall safe. In addition, our balcony was complete with bench and hammock, which were great for watching the sun go down. Freddie himself is so very nice, and he goes around to each person at dinner to talk with them and then introduces the menu to the whole dining room. The food is simply", "Freddies the owner is a nice person and the food served on buffet breakfast was so good and come with a very good price. I would love to go back to stay here and enjoy the dinner buffet as the breakfast already so good. We love the lasagna inside the toast. Yumm!! We also have a good time to swim in hotel area and altough we didn't stay there (we've stayed in another property of Freddie) he let us use the bathroom and changing room for all 34 of us :)", "We spent 5 days at Freddies in late December 2014. I had been told it was a special place but it was even more special than we had expected. Freddie was wonderful! His cooking was extraordinary, night after night, sumptuous 4 course meals, including an amazing Christmas day buffet, and he helped us make the most of our days on the island, explaining how to find the waterfall, hiring us motorbikes, going the extra mile. We can't recommend this place highly enough! Our bungalows overlooked the sea and it was even more amazing than the website photos showed (usually it's the opposite!). My husband and I went with our adult children (27,25 and 23) and it gave us holiday memories we will never forget. Thank you, Freddie!", "We stayed here as a family back in April'14 and overall had a great time. The beach is the best you can get on Pulau Weh and the snorkeling as well. The bungalows are well furnished, with a balcony offering stunning views of kitsch sunrises and the beach fringed by palm trees. They provide hammocks as well. We also had one of the rooms which was part of the main building and this was very spacious, also with a balcony. They are all well designed using natural materials (bamboo furniture). As for the food there are two restaurants, one in the main building and one on the beach, serving lunch and evening meals. Problem with the beach restaurant was the quite limited menu and the fact that their kitchen was very small. This meant that on weekends or when visitors from outside", "Great beach...Good food ...great service.. clean room...feels homey...friendly staff and ofcourse friendly Friddie...perfect place to stay.. thank you for giving great room ...I have great room view...", "we came here for 1 nights for enjoy after meeting in Banda Aceh. the rooms though not plush are everything we need with same extra touches like free water, tea, coffee making equipment. we stayed in rooms with view from balcony is lovely. Breakfast as delicious and healthy. thanks Freddie, we'll be came back again with all family for holiday.", "We came for 3 nights and stayed for 6. It was an outstanding experience. The rooms though not plush are everything you could need with some nice extra touches like free water and tea and coffee making equipment. They are nicely private and cleaned daily by Freddies excellent staff. Nearly all have excellent views of the beach which is very picturesque. Freddie and his staff are superb and everyone is very helpful. My wife was ill for some of the time and Freddie arranged for us to be taken to the local medical centre and brought back. The highlight of the day was the nightly buffet. They are superb. 4 courses of very good quality food with Freddie every night explaining the dishes and checking on guest satisfaction. Fantastic. Freddie has this place very well organised", "Stayed there 6 days and I' d love to stay more, but all rooms were full. Rooms are spacious, very clean, with an amazing ocean view. I loved the beach, allthough we couldn't go anywere (muslim law stands in the area) Freddie is THE PERSON!!! I certainly love to go back sometime", "What I liked best: -the rooms are right on a slope next to the beach, and the view of the sea from the room balcony and window are gorgeous. -dinners cooked by Freddie and his team - wonderful food, excellent range and variety, prepared & delivered with a huge helping of heart and love. -not a single mosquito did I encounter during my entire 4 night stay there. No need for repellents whatsoever. -excellent service. Freddie and his team are always helpful, always courteous, a pleasure to talk to, -a huge bottle of drinking water (the size used in office water coolers) in the room -spacious balcony for sitting in, wash lines and pegs for drying clothes -outdoor deck (where food can be ordered). when it's cooler in the evening, it's a great place for reading, a beer, or a", "We stayed here with a group of friends for one week. What a good choice it was! The owner, Freddie, is a truly charming person, who takes really care of his guests in a very personalised way - there is a definitively \"feel good\" atmosphere in this place. The bungalows all have stunning views over the coconut-fringed beach. They are simple but include in fact all what you need: fan, free suply of drinking water, balcony, hammock, etc. We can also highly recommend the evening buffet meals, which are freshly prepared every day. Unlike many other places (including 5-star hotels) there were not two same dishes for the whole week we stayed - the food was so good that we ended up eating there every night. The beach is excellent, with good snorkelling and lots of fish! Our week passed", "The strength of this place is the hospitality and privateness. As an owner, Freddie manage to take good care of everything. Making sure visitors are happy with complete amenities in its bungalow (surprised to have cold & hot water dispenser), assistance in travel logistic, to its well-known dishes. Freddie greets people with warmth and kind attention to each person. He always, always, and always share his menu for dinner so people won't get confused with its range of yummy feast on the table. I personally like the beach, because it is personal. Private and not crowded. You can easily find your desired favourite spot to relax. I witness myself how people love to come and enjoy the environments at Freddie's even if they do not stay there. My advice would be you need to", "We went on a Saturday for the buffet dinner, it was amazing, the best food I ever had in the island and probably one of the best of my Asian trip so far. We went on a big group and had a great time, after dinner we walked through the beautiful beach to casanemo for some drinks, perfect Saturday in Pulau weh.", "Freddies is a very nice place to be. The cottages are basic but clean with hot shower. The beach is fantastic; of course it has some dead coral in the sand, but that\u2019s how it is; it\u2019s a natural and not artificial beach. Snorkeling is very nice with lots of colorful fish and nice hard coral; once I saw a turtle; other guests even spotted some eagle rays. If you are lucky you can even see dolphins swimming by (far out in the ocean). The atmosphere of Freddies is closely link to the very nice and helpful guy \u201cFreddie\u201d who runs the place by himself. Unfortunately if he\u2019s not there, things get little bit more complicated, as the staff doesn\u2019t speak English very well and it\u2019s quite hard to communicate. Nevertheless I really enjoyed my stay and if possible, I will come back somewhen!", "A beautiful location with really good service. The snorkelling is excellent here. Freddie was a wonderful host. We had three weeks here and really enjoyed it. Highly recommended. Thanks Freddie and your team!!", "We stayed here for a week. The rooms are cabins with fans, clean and all have sea views. It was great to have beach and sea after jungle trekking. It is a lovely spot, however when you look it seems that the whole village dispose of their rubbish either side of Freddies. It was horrible, I asked for bin bags and collected loads, because when you see the beautiful Turtles you don't want them to die from swallowing plastic. It would seem that the local population have a 'banana leaf' view of waste disposal, which was okay when it was just a banana leaf to throw away but now something must be done to educate and quickly! Freddie does his best to keep the beach clean but I fear it is a losing battle. I was in our cabin and heard a noise outside thinking that it could be a monitor or", "I love Freddies. He is warm and clearly loves what he does everyday. His workers respect him and his resort is very clean. I love the fact that he accommodates my mother's needs who cannot walk very many steps. He put us as close as possible to the beach. His food is wonderful and the beach is cleaner than the other side. I learned that he asked his worker to pick trash up at the beach. I love that he does it. I also love the fact I can snorkle right off the beach and that he planted new corals as well. Love the place and would stay again if I visit Sabang.", "This place has a very laid back feel to it and the set dinner is great as Freddie combines South African, Indonesian and Western cuisine in general to create comforting, tasty, wholesome food. The service is very friendly and snorkelling in front of the resort, heading right towards Casa Nemo, is pretty rewarding for very little effort. The rooms are clean but basic, offering decent value budget accommodation on the island. I believe that the resort will soon be renovated, so there will be some family beach front villas available in the near future.", "Freddie's is a great place to stay in Sabang. Nice cottage, amazing view, friendly staff, incredible food...i mean really really incredible! Freddie is the chef too, he really knows how to cook! You should take the dinner package, it was amazing! Four star food quality, i think i gained more than 5 kg when i stay there for 3 days. Loving the breakfast as well. I love coffee from Aceh. On their menu, they have a nyummy pizza, burger, noodle, sandwich, steak in a fair price and huge portion. I can't stop talking about the food, Freddie's knows how to make his guest happy :) The view from our cottage was breathtaking. The private beach is really beautiful, they have a clean beach, clean cottage, no words needed .... loves everything. I shall be back!", "Great! Simply great, wonderful wooden cabins, fresh food buffet (breakfast and dinner) every day, gorgeous surroundings, ticket back to Ferry arranged for you. Very helpful people. Just wake up, go to the water, swim, rest on the beach. Pet some of the cute cats there.", "Loved this place. The Bungalows were fantastic and despite what I was told there were no mosquitoes in the rooms so no need for mossie nets. There was always a cool breeze and the views were breathtaking. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. This was the first place in Sumatra that had large water dispensers in the rooms which is so much better than the 2 small plastic bottles supplied by more expensive hotels. I hate the fact that other hotels dont do this and expect you to pollute the environment with plastic bottles and pay for more bottles. Congratulations to Freddie and his staff for a wonderful stay!", "Love this place so much, I do love a whole package.. Private beach, the food, the staffs, and of course, Freddy the owner.. I stayes here 3 nights with my friends, Freddy called us \"The Perempuans\" because we all are girls.. We took family room with beach view, everything were excellent except bathroom in room 11, bad smell. I wish they put a big fan in room because Sabang is too hot.. Btw, you must try Freddies Pizza, crunchy and yumyum.. See you soon, Freddies!", "We loved everything at Freddies. The bungalows were spacious and clean with an awesome view. The restaurant was really good and we also enjoyed the common dinner which gave us the feeling to eat as a \"family\".

I'll be back!", "Planned to stay for 3 nights only, but end up with 4, it's not because of flight changed but the comfortability and joy in Freddies. The view from every corner are awesome, crystal clear coral bed beach and tropical fish just inch from you. The buffet meal prepared by Freddies are amazing, fusion cuisine between the Indonesia and western. thumb up!!", "We stayed at Freddie's for 4 nights having been recommended by a friend who visited a year ago. We had high expectations and they were exceeded completely. The room was perfect, we had bungalow 9 which was the second floor of a two storey building, it was spacious, clean and airy, the shower was powerful and hot and the balcony had stunning views out over the sea. The beach out front is easily the best on the island (we hired a motorbike for two days to explore) and the walk in snorkeling is superb (for similar snorkeling from Iboih you really need to take a boat over to the island opposite, you can swim but it's tiring). Freddie and his team were incredibly welcoming, friendly and polite and the buffet food they cooked each night was incredible. We didn't envisage eating", "I stayed at Freddies with two other friends for 2 nights. I personally picked this place because of the word of mouth of how nice the location is. I stayed in Iboih for 3 weeks last year, it was very basic, so I decided to taste a bit of comfort in the other side of the island. The best of Freddies is the location, by far. The beach is amazing. It has the sunrise, the clear blue waters, the cottages overlooking the open sea. The food was also great and the price was reasonable enough (I was expecting food to be terribly expensive). The staff are full of smiles and helpful. The room we had was spacious, fit for 4 people because of the bunk beds. Now, the part I totally hate: the beach is open for public. ARGH! So annoying to have 30+ people in full clothing screaming everytime", "Freddies is a little gem set on a beautiful beach with friendly helpful staff. From the start to the end of our holiday everything was sorted out for us. Freddy was just awesome when we booked our stay. He set all the costs out for us on a spreadsheet, including details of cab fares, ferries costs and he also booked us a hotel for the night in Banda Aceh as our flight arrived too late to get the last ferry. The spreadsheet detailing costs was very helpful as our taxi driver tried to charge us triple what Freddy had told us - but armed with this knowledge we were not ripped off! The 'resort' itself is gorgeous. It's rustic and cosy. our cottage (B7) was amazing. It had a great view, a warm shower, safety box, great balcony and nice bed! We were very happy with our little", "We booked adjoining bungalows, one with a double bed and one with 3 beds for our kids. We were quite apprehensive when we found out we were in the double storey bungalows after reading a very nasty review on TripAdvisor. But what a pleasant surprise. These bungalows had everything we hoped for. Bright bathrooms, nice furniture on the balconies, hammock, close to the beach, good fan, a lot of shelving, comfortable bed, working fridge, coffee and tea service, security door we could leave open at night to enjoy the sea breeze, lock-up safe for our laptops, nice beach and sea views, what more could we ask for? Noise from the main building? No, and we were right next to the main building. Loud music from the restaurant? No not true. Noise from the neighbours above us? Yes at times", "I stayed here on my previous vacation for 1 night which was on November 2013. My experience here was very memorable. I can directly see and feel the breeze of the sea right from my room's terrace. The room is pretty big (Room 9) and i just noticed that it was a family room capacity room hahahah... The only consideration from me is on the cleanliness in the toilet and also the bed because there were some insects on it. Thanks to Freddie's Resort team for their hospitality.", "We stayed at Freddie's for 2 nights, wanted 4 but the weekend was very busy, Freddie recommended another place for the weekend. We had a traditional bamboo cottage which was very nice and comfortable, good size and everything we needed, tea and coffee making, safe, fan, nice clean bathroom and wonderful balcony and view over the sea. The restaurant is also very good, especially Freddie's special pizza. The staff Re all very nice, friendly, helpful and most of them can speak English? The beach is very nice and good for swimming, also very peaceful, will be back. Thanks Freddie for all you help.

Unfortunately we (with 2 kids) had to carry our luggage by ourselves going to the main building (extra careful for the edges going down). Hope Freddie's worker can help with the luggage, because he saw us & just show the place to check-in. Immediately saw Freddie at the kitchen & he greeted us. Our Family Room was upstairs of the dining area (of the main building). Accessible only through the kitchen (hope there will be other way to access the room in the future).

Diving here is amazing and Scuba Weh offered a really good price for both fun dives and Padi courses. They are in fact really nice.

During off peak or low season it is not necessary to book accommodation in advance as you can find plentiful rooms at Ibioh beach at reasonable prices however I understand it can get crowded during weekends. Apart from the those guest house along the street facing the main beach you can find huts if you walk further up the footpath along the shoreline. We found Fatimah\u2019s bungalow located up the slope after passing Rubiah Tirta Dive Centre. The wooden hut perched on the slope with zinc sheet roof has toilet / bathroom ( with cold shower ) and a small balcony with hammock overlooking the sea. The rooms are basic with no frills and fitting for the price. Apart from the beds, they do not provide anything else. No wifi, towels, blankets, drinking water or even toilet paper. You can request or buy from the several nearby kiosks. No air condition, just fans. The evenings are cool and breezy and even chilly if it rains so AC is really not necessary. A caution that rain splashing on the zinc sheet roof can cause a racket and keep you awake at night if you are a light sleeper. It\u2019s paramount to consider that Ibioh being largely undeveloped does not have good waste disposal infrastructure therefore its paramount that visitors only use what is necessary so that the place can maintain it\u2019s idyllic charm. We have witness so many beautiful places spoilt by sheer wanton litter.", "Very nice beach, amazingly clear water for snorkeling.", "As a beach, Iboih really isnt very attractive. There aren't miles of white sandy beaches. Instead, there's a short & narrow beach with brown sand and some rocks. If you are expecting sunbathing, swimming in the sea and beach volleyball...you couldnt be further from the truth.", "Came to Sabang for a diving trip. The water was as clear as the sky. Stayed at Fina bungalow..small and decent, quite comfortable, value for money. (but no hot shower.hehe). Food was fairly easy to find, price slightly higher than Acheh mainland. As for the diving, it was lovely. Slight current for all dives, but I loved the underwater volcano the most.. we went with Rubiah Tirta DC. People here are very nice and hospitable. Worth the visit!", "Was the perfect place to go through our advanced open water: a lot of hard/soft corals with plenty of corals fishes. Some spot for deep dive and some for drift dive with big fishes. Exactly in front of Rubiah island where we had one amazing night dive!

Talk with other tourists in the cafe area as you cross paths heading north and south in Sumatra. We planned a week and it's been 2 now, hate to leave but visa is almost up!", "if you traveling solo, ask around it sure help! Will be to crowded during the weekend mostly on long holidays.", "Quite nice small snady beach but I already saw better and more colorful coral reefs in Indonesia - for example in Amed on Bali...", "First off, here are no baboons on Pulau Weh! Yes, there are macaques and if they have been fed by humans before, they may approach. Iboih Beach would best be described as a place that lots of young Indonesians and backpackers go to snorkel. The sandy bottom and clear water make it easy to see fish. So if you have never seen a coral reef, this is a place you can see that and a place you can float on the water and enjoy seeing undersea life. Iboih Beach felt sort of haphazard to me, with a jumble of small bungalows, tourist shops and new construction going on, trash floating in the water and on the beach, and visible damage to the coral reef, all interspersed with a traditional Muslim community where the women are covered head-to-toe. Everyone co-exists and Sharia Law seems to only exist for the residents. From my perspective, it seems like Pulau Weh is getting overfished, both inshore and offshore. So many fishing boats offshore, and the little inshore local boats every day, pulling fish from the bay. In the Sabang market, it was heartbreaking to see so many reef fish for sale. Thankfully, further down the beach there is a protected sanctuary where supposedly no fishing or spearfishing (or even snorkelling) is allowed. I preferred snorkelling from Steffans Dive Resort where the reef seems to be recovering from the most recent tsunami, and there are more fish.", "i went to iboih beach sometime back and was taken by the amazing sea creatures and coral that you got to see even without diving. just simply snorkling around the shore gave me a view that i have never been able to compare to.", "Spent a week here after a business trip to Malaysia and had read quite a bit about how great the reefs were. If you are a young backpacker who has never seen a tropical fish in its natural habitat before, then this is an inexpensive place to try out snorkelling or diving. Indeed you will see nice fish here, but it doesn\u2019t hold a candle to Papua, Palau, Raja Ampat or any of the South Pacific. This opinion was not just mine, but was shared by several well travelled Germans and Canadians who we met while on Sabang. So if you are a veteran diver looking to be impressed, this isn\u2019t going to be the place. Coral has taken multiple hits from tsunamis, bleaching and hordes of backpackers/divers. Overfishing also appears to also be a huge problem, though locals don\u2019t seem to want to admit to it (ask any of the local dive masters and they seem to think everything is ok, but depends on what you have as comparatives!)", "This little paradise well preserved is a nice place to stay with small children. The village people are friendly and cool and you can enjoy easily on the nice beach for snorkling, making pictures, eating ... chilling.", "nice beach with turquoise clear water, no big wave and you can find some colorful fish nearby. you can also find many local food stall around to try. you can take boat rent to go to rubiah island from this beach.", "The best place to do snorkeling or diving. The wheater is good during dry season, no big wave and clear water with many colorful fish and anemon clearly seen from the sampan (small boat).", "Iboih beach is among the most interesting attractions on the island of Pulau Weh, beside Sumur Tiga Beach and Gapang. The water is always turquoise and the snorkeling there quite stunning. People might have to venture a bit further with a local boat hire to visit Pulau Rubiah and Seulako. Both islands are a mere 5 minutes away from Iboih beach.", "I visited Sabang during a long weekend holiday in August and Iboih Beach was very crowded. The trip to Rubiah Island for snorkeling was not too pleasant, there were too many people and it was heavy rain :(", "Iboih is really a great place to be. I want to especially recommend a snorkel Trip we did today with Raja. you can find him in Olala or at Deedee. He is one of the most relaxed and best guides I ever met. Took us out at 6 to watch for and snorkel with dolphins. We found a group of ~ 20-30. After this we had a great breakfast, went snorkeling in volcanic sulfur bubbling out of the bottom of the sea. Bought a huge yellow fin tuna directly from a fisherman on the sea and had that fish as bbq on a wonderful remote clean, white sand island beach. Best snorkeling day ever! Only thing: Boat is a bit loud - diesel engine from the 50's or so. Price was reasonable, Rp. 250,000.", "Nice place to stay for a while but too touristic..If you are looking for relaxing time, i would recommend the east side of the island..but Iboih is a good place if you wanna do scuba diving, cause the boats leave from there..", "Many backpacker lodge on the other side of the main street, you can reach there for 5 minutes of walk on the big stairs. Beware, the becak driver will say that the place is too far.", "Several companies for diving courses. Very friendly people.", "we stayed in Iboih for 2 nights.There are other beaches such Sumur Tiga,Gapang and Pasir Anoi Hitam but this is nicer and many people around.The resort is expensive compare to facility they have.To swim you hv to take boat to Pulau Rubiah 10 minutes.No faciliti in Pulau Rubiah except stall selling foods.They should upgrades Pulau Rubiah like built chalets or toilets to change cloth after swimming.In Iboih beaches there are few stall selling local food and in the evening you can hv goreng pisang and cofee and sitting facing the sea.too relax.At night one rest name Abah Alue selling nice sea food with reasonable price but the service very slow.", "beautiful and cosy place with very nice people. There are also some good restaurants for a quick stopover and in the village you can get small supplies for the day.", "I really like chilling out at Iboih beach. This place is ideal to relax. Not too small, not too big and truly indonesian. Food & drinks are easy to get. From Iboih beach you can snorkel along the coast and end up at yulia's peer, on the way you gonna spot cuttle fish, octopus & other common reef fishes ...", "Love this beach, full of people when it's a long weekend. But nice place to snorkel. Come here with friends for weekend. Pass all day to snorkel. We got a guide to show us around and get us to best place to snorkel.", "We spent only couple of hours there while doing round the island tour - the place was too crowded and commercial for our liking ...", "We were lucky to have a great becak driver to show us around town for cheap, I would recommend this guy, Ivan is his name, number is +62 823 70752114.

Had a good seafood along iboih beach and I would want to come back here again one day!", "Iboih Beach is so beautiful, the sea water is totally blue clean! You even can see many fishes and sea creatures without even try. Because the locals don't catch the fishes, so the fishes are very friendly to us. You must find the perfect weather to come.", "Iboih beach has corals starting from ankle deep. Its laid back, clean with plenty of spots eat, relax and sleep under a Tree.", "We spent 5 days diving in Iboih, we stayed elsewhere on the island, but went diving here. I'd recommend 2 places for lunch.", "We went snorkeling there with a boat that we rent for 200.000 rupiah. The beach was full from corall pieces and little white sand crabs. Under the water there was many different types of colourful fish that amazes every swimmer. It was really shame that there where no coralls left after the tsunami, but on the other hand it was very reassuring that many coralls were starting there reconstruction.", "Iboih beach is one of main attraction in Weh Island. A lot of water sports activities offered here, from snorkeling, diving and watching dolphin trip. The price is quite standard for all but if you have a good negotiating skills, it might help.", "A number of dive centers, yoga centers and eateries dot this stretch of beach.

Beaches are small and most of it had turned to jetty or boat port including Iboih beach. But you can still enjoy the view", "One of main beach of sabang that's why it's crowded. Offer many homestay but only 2 star hotel. Have snorkling area just 5 minutes by boat", "This is a pretty little beach on Pulau Weh, but it runs the risk of over-development without some proper care and attention. The beach is really very small but yet there is quite a bit of construction going on. Whilst not exactly the mass tourism you get in Thailand, there is still the danger of heading in that direction without some care. The water here is really clear and looks like a great place for snorkelling.", "Snorkeling is great here. I would suggest to get a half day boat for 3 person or more. You could go around the beach and to the small island opposite and a few spots around there for snorkeling. Clear water and lots of fish and coral.", "The beach was OK. The sand is white and the view is very good. You can see the fisherman boats there. I was only 15 minutes stop at this beach, but it was good.", "An amazing place to dive and see the beauty of marine life. It should be improved for lodging facilities such and adequate Hotels in accordance with tourism standard", "Iboih Beach is a nice spot for a relaxed holiday. The village has a slow and friendly pace but livens up a bit on weekends with local pleasure seekers enjoying what's on offer: this includes some reasonable snorkelling sites; a range of places to eat; and a range of laces to stay. To make the most of your stay I recommend a boat trip to get you out to some of the other snorkelling sites and you might also consider renting a motorbike (there's not much traffic and is quite slow going)", "This place was great. The beach scenery was fantastic. you can enjoy the reef along this beach. The only negative thing was, you would hardly find a restaurants that serve various menus.

A great and well populated coral garden that is recovering well from Tsunami damage", "Iboih beach is the perfect place to escape.

Will back for diving! \ud83d\ude0d", "One of the most beautiful places I have ever been. Sadly we couldn't snorkel as we went during Ramadan and they don't rent out snorkels until 2pm on weekends in that period and we were just there for the morning. This did mean there was no one else on the beach with us! We just had to be respectful (of course) and quiet while we were there. Very lovely morning.", "A clean shore line.

But little bit hard to find a restaurant with the good taste.", "We go there for snorkeling, but too crowded. Accomodation still minimum. Not really comfort when go there. Underwater object is great.

A lot of fishes and absolutely beautiful. Best beach I've ever visited within 3 countries I've been.", "Iboih offers a nice snorkeling and diving area. Great to see the underwater world.

You have a choice of food and stores within walking distance.", "The area is overcrowded with lots of accommodation and simple eateries, but there is really not much to do.

It cost us 300,000 Rupiah for 5 people which included travel from Gapang Beach Resort to Iboih beach and boat transfer to Rubiah island and snorkelling gear.

I really don't like seeing women bing topless or G-string bikinis on the beach in Asia, where people are having conservative life style.", "My trip to Weh island was nice. We did some water sports there with reliable costs such snorkeling and diving. We booked via Freddie's Homestay. This accommodation is not bad with ocean view room and fit in our budget.

At the whole island the beaches are just full of rocks,difficult to get in and strong currents.

However there are far from locals places where european girls can swim without being intimidated.", "Beautiful, but please avoid during Indonesia public holiday, or else all hotels on the island will be unbelievably full (including their main town!- many were trapped and slept by the beach without accommodation- at least that's what I saw during my visit). It is already commercialised beach, but still the clear water and the green surrounding worth a visit. Went there twice as the first day was too overcrowded. The diving experience was great with some moderate current, but the corals I believe that they've had better days before tsunami. All the dive centers seemed very helpful and some even provided free pickup from Sabang town.", "It was a beautiful area. And the snorkeling was good with a heap of fish.

The accommodation was fantastic , and the food was awesome. The pool and deck set up is amazing. Lise and Chris made us very welcome , and Chris was the perfect surf guide in and out of the water. Plenty of bikes to use any time and two vans to take us any where any time . I'm 60 yrs old , and managed my first barrel , my son on the other had may have had at least 20 .

I travelled to Simeulue from Singapore, left Singapore at 6 in the morning and was in the surf at lunch time, super easy travel. The camp is fantastic, really nice rooms, the food is incredible and just the nicest most relaxed people. Mahi Mahi have really managed to develop an almost family feeling to the resort. Being off season the swell wasn\u2019t the best but there are heaps of waves around the island and we still got really fun waves every day. Only wish had had longer to take advantage of all the facilities on the resort and to explore more of the island and find more waves. I could not recommend the place enough, one of the last unspoilt paradises. Cannot wait to return.", "It was a beautiful 2 month stay with my boyfriend. Great please to retreat and reflect, super nice calm stay without big city life or touristic distractions, wave sounds and raw nature. Mahi-Mahi has wonderful caring hosts, who make sure that guests have there best time. and the FOOD... food is delicious! Surf, yoga twice a day, golf and beach volleyball opportunity and the best swimming pool time with the sunset views. We had jungle hikes and 2 diving and snorkeling trips to paradise islands close to Simeulue. That was Lit!", "I booked an introduction to scuba experience today, and had the absolute time of my life! I'm on a beautiful remote island here in Sumatra with white sand beaches, coral reefs and gorgeous tropical scenery. Chad, a really chill Australian, took me out for my first scuba experience. He is incredibly patient, really calm, and introduced me to a whole new world that I'm very excited to dive into, pun intended. I enjoyed this so much that I plan on getting scuba certified back home, then coming back in a few months so he can take me and my fiance on a great guided tour of the underwater world here. Thanks Chad, you're awesome!", "This place was next level amazing! The location is spectacular. The wave straight out the front was as good as I have ever surfed. The accommodation was spot on. And the people were happy, friendly and super helpful. I would HIGHLY recommend a stay here. Had the most amazing time! Highlights- surfing the peak in 4-6ft clean conditions on several occasions, getting barrelled at Teabags on our last day. Eating the most amazing food 24/7. Watching the sunset over the water with an icy cold bintang in hand. Riding a buffalo :-)", "I went to Mahi Mahi in July 2018. I was met at the airport by an un-uniformed man, in an unmarked van - not a good start when I'm a women traveling alone with a daughter. The room had no air conditioning, linen was stained, no chairs to sit on in room. Shared bathroom facilities which often ran out of toilet paper and I only managed one hot shower in the 2 weeks I was there! The food was included but way too spicey and I got sick even when only eating the resort food and drinking the filtered water. There was no TV and no music. Very poor internet connection and the resort kept changing the password to bump you off! Poorly fenced property so water buffalo, goats, dogs and cats strayed into property regularly. No pool fencing so not safe for children. The boat owned by the resort was broken down so I was not taken to Bangkaru island as was planned to see the turtles. The van owned by the resort had to be push started when we were out in it one day. The volunteer work was nearly non-existent. I was miss-lead entirely and would not recommend this place to anyone. Don't go here!", "Stayed here for 4 nights In early May 18. I LOVED: > The beautiful gardens > The rooms (super comfortable with amazing views) > Location - you really can't beat staying just in-front of the peak. > Free yoga DID NOT LOVE: > NOT all inclusive; Even though I paid more than $600 USD for 4 nights, I still had to pay for things here and there. E.g. want a coffee outside of breakfast hours? Thats 35k please :( >Surf guiding...if you're lucky: the surf guiding was not so fair - my group did not get the chance to be guided once during our time...other groups where randomly given preference...we where promised a session but it never happened. > Vegetarian options....kind of: we were told that they could accomodate vegetarians, and they COULD, but they didn't do the best job of it. Some meals where great, others where average. E.g. some meals I ate beans and rice. Don't get me wrong, I love eating beans and rice...when I stay in budget surf camps If it were not for those things I would have given this place 5 stars. The good news is, they are easily fixed! Overall it was a pretty cool experience.", "Wowee, this place is heaven! Amazing surf, great food and the staff are awesome. Natedog, Captain Britt and Shaun were always able to answer any questions. The resort is super nice and has prime viewing for the perfect a-frame right at your doorstep. Highly recommend to anyone regardless if they surf or not!", "I enjoyed 11 great nights in one of the new beachfront ensuite units. The accommodation is great, with good beds and large bathroom. A big fan keeps you cool at night and insects away. Every unit has an uninterrupted view of the surf break, which is directly in front of the dining room. The onsite managers who are Kiwi/Swedish are super friendly and fantastic when my boards were lost temporarily by the airline. A couple of calls and they were found and on their way to me at the island. I was among the first guests, and resort was still being built during my stay, but the work didn't affect me. The food is basic, but very substantial, which is what you need when you're surfing three or four times a day. I understand that it will become more varied in the near future. The surf guide, a saffa/kiwi, has an intimate knowledge of the area and we visited several other breaks on the island, including boat trips to breaks offshore, including a world-class barreling right - with only four of us out, and a mellow long left with just three in the water. I thoroughly recommend Mahimahi to anyone who wants to surf uncrowded, quality surf in a beautiful location. Their commitment to sea turtle conservation work is also a very nice touch.", "My friend and I have just returned from a two week stay at the Mahi Mahi and we only have good things to say about the place! From the minute we arrived, we were made to feel welcome. Nate and the crew took the time to ensure our stay was as enjoyable as possible. We stayed in the villa and it was awesome. Spacious, bright and very clean. The food was excellent. From sushi night to more local dishes, the quality was high and there was always plenty to go around. Apart from surfing, the yoga sessions with Jess were also really enjoyable. Having scooters available to borrow is also really useful as the days when the peak wasn't working, we were able to explore the beautiful island of Simulue. Having seen some of the other accommodation options on the island, I would definitely", "Stayed here for 3 weeks and scored good waves right in front of the resort. The resort is brand new, with some buildings still to be completed so everything was nice and fresh. Indo-style food was good. Nice crew, relaxed atmosphere. Will be even better when fully operational.", "We arrived and were picked up from Matt who worked at the resort, and from the minute we were picked up to the minute we were dropped off we were taken care of with 5 star service. The food was amazing, and I mean all of it from breakfast, lunch and dinner. Their chef is incredible and doesn't miss a beat! Having Bintang on offer is also nice after a full day in the sun- Definitely recommend this place- there are fun waves out front, down the road at Dylans, and numerous other spots that it will be just you and your buddy out at-", "Second time back, 19 day trip, I was a little skeptical of going back a second time, but first time round was so good. There had been minor changes made around the place but they all were changes for the better. Little pitch and putt golf course fun. Went on the boat trip with the other reviewer Davedon (terrible at cards, but a good dude!!Oh Hi Dave) and that was definitely worth every cent. The thing with going to MahiMahi is that you meet people of a similar mind set. It's low key and no hassles. The food again was great, and plenty of it. They make you breakfast off a great little breakfast menu from poached eggs to banana pancakes. I'll go back for sure.....again", "A mate and I spent the first 2 weeks of June at Mahi Mahi. We were pretty blown out from the minute we arrived. Fantastic location, great room with a view and an empty wave out front. Our flight landed about 2.30pm and we were out surfing The Peak within an hour. Everyone who works there is awesome, they all add such a good feel to the place. Anna, Shaun, Ryan, Ross, Britt, Luke and Jane and the local team. Really good meals, fish, curries with a bit of western, especially appreciated the real butter, coffee and they make their own bread. Even the baking was the best. Can't fault the resort. June in Indonesia pumped! From day 2 the swell got too big for the Peak so we headed off down to Dylans. I had thought that as it was pretty much the only place handling the swell it", "Really nice place, super chilled vibe, great staff, solid food ... and waves right out front. Good for groups and also if solo. Not much else there but surfing but thats all you need! Bikes to get around the island too", "Such a wonderful place to stay and especially it's good spot for surfing. The resort staff were super friendly especially Nathan with his great hospitality towards the guest and the food served were good as well. I would suggest this as best resort to spend your holiday with your buddies or family\u263a\ufe0f", "Spent 16 days here in July 2016. Great trip, great people running the resort, and even the Surf guide is okay for a South African....(joke). Couldn't spend much money up there as it was all exclusive except snacks and drinks, but these were very cheap. Got some great waves and surfed everyday. Boat trip to nearby islands a must, great waves. Already planned to go back in 2017. The food was good, a mix of indo and sushi, had Spag Bol one night, always enough food, coffee was good. Soda's and snacks available to buy.", "Had an amazing time staying here, the staff were incredible, weather was nice and scored some great waves. Very beautiful villas and met some really great guests who were also staying. Breathtaking island and perfect resort. Highly recommend it!", "Staying at the Mahi-Mahi Resort was the highlight of my trip! It felt like we were with family, the staff and locals are so welcoming and friendly. The food was absolutely delicious, we found ourselves counting down to each meal. The rooms are stunning, and the location is RIDICULOUS! The surfers would wake up each morning and the waves were right on their door step, with deep rock pools and a swimming bay also out the front. Cannot say enough about this resort! They really went above and beyond for everyone. Not only is it an amazing surf resort but they also have affiliated with an eco-volunteer program in order to help conserve the surrounding islands sea turtle populations, more tourism organisations and resorts should be environmentally conscious like Mahi-Mahi!!", "We had almost 14 nights here, which unfortunately was a bit long when we only a few days of good surf, the rest of the time it was flat. We tried to scope out other locations but nothing was breaking. My boyfriend says the wave out the front isn't the perfect wave but is still fun. The Kitchen staff are wonderful and the food is really good, although a few operational things in the kitchen still need to be worked on. There isn't much food options outside of the resort. The location is lovely and the grounds are beautiful and well cared for. The couples room is big and spacious and well looked after each day. There are quite a few mozzies hanging around so bring plenty of bug spray! The Wifi works but is extremely slow but its surprising they even have it on an island like", "Mahi Mahi is epic. If you know how to surf and do it for a good cause (turtle conservation) then it won't get better than this. You can do yoga sessions, go explore some amazing environments on the island and beyond, and of course most importantly: surf your soul out! It's fantastic, not only does the house break provide some of the most consistent waves on the island, but there's also a beach break right next to it if you'd like to practice in a somewhat less challenging spot first. I loved the hospitality, the fact that the entire island is pretty much still up to its original environmental and cultural status, the diversity of surf spots and also the incredibly delicious food. Everyone who works there is really friendly and helpful and the rooms are perfect.", "I came to Mahi Mahi surf resort to meet family over Christmas and New Year. It's one long long journey from the U.K but it's certainly worth every minute. We were so lucky with the surf it was double over head+ and barrels most days! The resort is amazing, everything is really natural and is a lovely way to spend a holiday. The rooms are just what you need looking out onto the peak which I think is the best spot on the island. Each meal you go into the Jogalo area where the girls create lovely meals 3 times a day. Fish tacos are the best! They'd always make fresh coconut milk for our coffees too. Everybody here is so friendly Ricky took us on surf trips, Anna was great and really helpful and we also met Luke and Jane who are amazing! I would really recommend staying here if", "Amazing Hospitality! Friendly Staff. Nate was amazing at just at the vibe of the place, just chill off the water and a ripper on it! He was great with his advice of what and where to go. We were even lucky enough to be taken on a bit of a surf mission with him! The food was plentiful, tasty and always on time. I can not say how much I loved the place as well as the amazing waves that surrounded it. I can not wait to go pack. I bloody hope Nate is there!", "A wonderful resort run by epic people. Accommodation, food and staff were all incredible. Super chilled out, and a proper opportunity to unwind. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to try escape the crowds and experience a bit of paradise.", "This was the best surfing holiday I have ever had. We had amazing waves every day from 3-8 ft, predominantly groomed by offshore or light winds.The accommodation was clean and tidy, the Indonesian style cuisine was always plentiful, fresh and well cooked (often fresh seafood). Anna was the most accommodating manager (and ships chef), Sean `sick bru' helped us score the waves of a lifetime. Brit was the best surfing captain and Sailfish lander. Ross was always helpful for any reason. Ryan was a true artist/daredevil with his photography, and Luke and Jane were tireless in their pursuit of an eco-friendly resort that supports the local people of Simeulue. Our highlight was an impromptu 3 day boat trip to the Banyak Islands to coincide with a new swell. The waves, fishing,", "Wuaooo what a trip on the mahi mahi boat with captain britt and his funny crew Let me try to explain how good this Captain is... If you let him do his job you will surf your brain out, simple as that We surf so many spot as the best tide and wind with insane conditions also he found amazing place to spend the night on a very nice a peace full seas 4 of the best days of my surfing life Also the food was very good his girlfriend cook good and the boys help a lot cleaning everything We also paid Williams to take pictures he had the best wave of my life and charge a very good price Please tip the crew the will be so stoke Thanks Captain Britt for everything Christian from Costa Rica", "Rooms delightful mix of tradition and style. Waves I could view from my room and walk to were super fun. Food delicious and aplenty. Fruit, coconuts, vego, fish cuisine and now they serve chai! Staff including locals were caring, friendly, laid back, helpful and open. Yoga pavilion is soon to be completed! Conservation programs ethical and admirable Overall a real retreat (with free wifi), admist waves and jungle!", "Great accomodation great staff, food, waves and even helped me out with flight bookings that went wrong while there. Beautiful untouched island a real old tropical island feel,one of the best surf trips I've done. Will definitely b going back soon.", "Stayed here for a couple of weeks with bro and mate. If you're going to Simeulue - Mahimahi is the place to stay. Right next door to Aura but much newer, nicer and surprisingly cheaper. Accommodation was beautiful, view of the main peak from my bed. Food was exceptional, buffalo rendang was a highlight. Surf was great and the crew were outstanding - thanks Anna, Shaun, Nate, Iona for a great time. Cheers, Reuben, Auckland NZ", "Stayed at Mahi Mahi for 2 weeks, unfortunately the break out front wasn't working during our stay (told is rare, saw plenty of photos to rub salt in the wound!). However, we managed to surf it a handful of times. Didn't affect our stay we had great waves all within short drive, minimal crowds and super friendly staff. Accommodation is basic but has everything you need, great food and offers great bang for buck! One of the better resorts on the island. Cheers Mike", "Just spent 7 nights with a crew of crusty old kiwi mates re-living our youth. I had a great time here. Accommodation was simple but great. Rooms cleaned every day with private bathroom. Food was very tasty and the staff were really helpful with a nice vibe about the place. Expat surf guides were competent and relaxed and happy to advise and assist. They were on tap to drive us to the surf anywhere most of the time. Wave in front not always on. They could do with a more reliable van but rustled up extra transport easily enough when needed. Surf ranged from ok to excellent around the coast semi local the entire time we were there. Waves really for intermediate and better level surfers. Not for learners unless you have a special interest in white water, coral reefs and sharp", "I was supposed to stay 2 1/2 weeks at Mahi Mahi but loved it so much I extended for another 2 1/2 weeks. The location could not be better. Waking up in the morning, you just have to walk onto your balcony to check the peak. The location is unbeatable. The facilities are great. The infinity pool is the greatest for a sunset spot. The twice daily yoga classes on offer and unique pool table mean there\u2019s plenty to do when you\u2019re not surfing. The staff are great. Chris was always making sure everyone was having a good time. The surf guide, Jay was awesome. He has such good energy and can get on with anyone. He has so many tips for the surf and the patience of a saint. On the odd day the conditions at the peak aren\u2019t great or you want a different wave they have a couple of vans", "Stayed there for two months and made my first steps in surfing there! So many good surfing spots around the island and the consistent wave just in front of the resort! Super friendly staff, great food, beautiful and clean rooms and generally great atmosphere in the resort! Would definitely recommend to anyone and I will definitely go back there!", "Mahi-Mahi surf resort is paradise! I was there for 16 days at the end of December and it was the best vacation of my life. (I\u2019m a 27 year old solo female traveller) The resort: It is located right on the beach with every room having a sea view. The grounds are very well kept and everything looks amazing. The water buffalos that groom the grass and the goats hanging out around the resort also give the place a special feel. The pool is so nice. It is a great spot to relax and cool down during the day and the perfect sunset watching spot for the evenings. The resort does have internet and it is quite good but only in the dedicated area. (you are here for fun in the sun anyway, not to be on your phone). The rooms: The rooms are super clean and pretty. They provide beach and bath", "I\u2019ve stayed here twice now and i\u2019ll Be going back for sure. This is without doubt the best surf / eco lodge on the island. The facilities are very good, the pool is a luxurious touch, especially as it\u2019s right in front of the most consistent surf break on the island. I really like the traditional Indonesian beach huts and the warm water is also a nice touch. You really can\u2019t go wrong with Mahi Mahi.", "We stayed at the Mahi Mahi resort for 4nights and really wished we could have stayed longer. The food was yummy, room had the best view and was keep super clean. Managed to get some fun waves, do yoga, explore the island and go on a snorkelling trip! Just perfect. I also have to mention the effort made to keep rubbish and plastic waste as minimal as possible and all of the conservation these guys are helping with on simeulue and surrounding islands! I am so happy that we stayed here and will be back soon! Aimee and Dan x", "Mahi Mahi surf resort was awesome! They have a great set up out there amongst an amazing island of waves (including the one right out front). To me I'm happy as long as we have good waves (which we did), but as a bonus the food was awesome (lots of variety inc. crayfish one night), the accomodation was clean / new and the staff where all also cool. To top it off they have Bintang =) As a muslim island beer is hard to get so extra star for keeping the guests happy =) !", "My partner and I stayed at Mahi-Mahi over the Easter break (he surfs, I don't). We booked a double deluxe room, as with all rooms very Mahi-Mahi our villa offered a view of the island\u2019s most consistent wave, \u201cThe Peak\u201d. Rooms are basic but clean, comfortable and spacious enough for two. We had a private bathroom, balcony, AC unit and fan. I believe the main difference between the standard and deluxe rooms is the availability of hot water. Warm showers were a nice to have, but as temperatures are pretty high all year round on Simeulue they\u2019re not a necessity. Room rates are all-inclusive and meals served at the Joglo are a tasty blend of local and western cuisines. Ingredients are all grown and sourced locally, often from Mahi-Mahi\u2019s organic community garden or their free-range", "The staff were very helpful and polite, the food was basic, but clean and nutritious. The upstairs villas are the better accomodation with air conditioning, always cleaned and tidied every day. The surf guide was always willing to take us to new surf spots, and was very helpful.", "This is a fantastic place for a surf trip. Incredible proximity to a year-round A-frame and phenomenal sunset views from a villa balcony or the pool. I managed to dislocate my shoulder on day 2 of the surf trip but was saved an hour trip to the nearest hospital by our surf guide, Richard. Even given 5 days without surfing, it is a good place to chill (the new WiFi set up was a bit unreliable but they seemed to be working on it) with decent food and opportunities to hike and fish. Fairly basic accommodation but cleaned by the time we had returned from breakfast each day and I'm not sure what else you need on a surf trip. Would definitely recommend for a lengthy surf trip or a few days of chill.", "The camp is the epitome of relaxation and cruise mode. The manager Anna was fantastic, she was organising activities to do when the surf was too windy and she really went out of her way to get to know my wife and I. The food on offer is buffet style and tastes fantastic, it's mostly organic self farmed at the resort and not too spicy. There's not a huge variety per meal, mainly rice, some veggies and a small meat option or vegetarian option, but with delicious sauces and condiments to go on it made it amazing. Breakfasts were awesome, totally recommend them! The main meals food did vary during the day and week and we never went hungry! You can buy limited alcohol here if that's your thing. You can get basic coffees and tea outside of meal times, you could also pay for cheap", "The resort is a beautiful place for surfing, relaxing in the air conditioned rooms, or kick back in the pool. The staff are amazing, broke my foot and found out their were no crutches available. They had their carpenter make me a crutch from scratch with in an hour! WOW Then found me real pair the next day! And there are a bunch of other waves to had on the island!! Dave", "Me and my girlfriend spent 7 days at Mahi Mahi in August and we didn't want to leave. Everything about the place is amazing - location, team, ocean, food, accommodation. Anna, Nate, Alia, Shaun and the team are incredibly welcoming. The kitchen team cook up absolutely awesome and abundant fresh meals 3 times a day. Loads of fresh ingredients and local dishes with plenty of meat, fish and veggie options. I'm looking forward to when they launch a cookbook. And the fact that everyone eats communally means its a really social atmosphere. Also, try as much of the weird and wonderful local fruit as you can. I'm a novice surfer, so didn't test out The Peak, which looked fairly big, but the beach breaks either side (less than 5 mins walk from the resort) were great fun. The waves", "The guys here really know how to look after their guests - they're super friendly, have great knowledge of Simeulue and surrounding islands and they're always happy to offer advice on what to do, where to go etc. The accommodation was even better than I was expecting and the food was simply great, every day. Even though we were there between 2 bigger swells there was still great waves at a good size and we surfed everyday. Keep up the good work Nate, Sean, Matt, Matt, Britt, Autumn and anyone else I forgot! :) Highly recommended", "After visiting several surf resorts around Indo, Mahi-Mahi is definitely one of my favorites. Despite bad weather during off season, we had an amazing time - the wave works even when there is no swell, yoga was exceptional, island hopping and secret cave are just one of the many other things to do. Thank you to the awesome Mahi-Mahi crew for having made our stay a delighting experience!", "We stayed at Mahi Mahi in September 2016. A family of 4, young kids 4 & 6 who had a ball in the big grassy area at the front of the property and loved seeing the buffalo walk up and down the beach. we all surfed every day. Great lil beginner beach for the kids and I out the front of Mahi Mahi, warm water, gentle waves, unspoilt beaches and gorgeous lil village nearby....and waves for experienced surfers at Mahi Mahi or a scooter or boat ride away. I love that the resort supports a turtle conservation project. The food was good and the people working at the resort were so lovely - all of them. A great holiday - sad it's over!! Thanks to all at Mahi Mahi. P.x", "Mahi Mahi was by far one of the best surf resorts I've been too! The staff are extremely welcoming, helpful, knowledgeable and super friendly. My room overlooked the main peak and was extremely clean and spacious with a true Indo vibe. The food was excellent and freshly prepared every day. This was a really sweet community vibe where everyone would eat together and go on mini surf trips to other breaks. Thanks so much for making my stay a perfect surf escape!", "Mahi Mahi is a very comfortable resort with an authentic Indonesian style. Fantastic food, breakfast, lunch and dinner! Simeulue still has very little tourism, so there isn't any real choice of restaurants or cafes, but you are so well looked after here you wouldn't want anything else. My fiance and I stayed for 3 weeks, and really did feel like we were on holiday with a group of friends. The staff are that great! Would love to go back again!", "I stayed on Simeulue Island for 2 months and Mahi Mahi is by far the place to be. It is so underpriced for what it is in comparison to other resorts. All bungalows are private so you aren't sharing, with a private rustic like bathroom and shower, they are all brand new and clean as with a view of the peak from your bed. The people there are a really cool, they are like family and will go way out of their way to make sure you have the most comfortable stay possible. Mahi Mahi do a lot for the people of Simeulue and their community so you tell any locals on the island that you are staying with Mahi and they will welcome you with a smile. The main point of difference that Mahi has over other resorts is it's location. The peak is an A-frame that breaks right in front of the resort."]}, {"place_name": "Mie Razali", "comment": ["Our tour guide recommended this restaurant.. I'd like to agree with him. In fact, it exceeds my expectations. It is located at central business of Banda Aceh City, Aceh Province, Indonesia. Usually it will be crowded in the weekend. If you're on your trip to Banda Aceh, this popular Mie Aceh should be on your list of culinary to try. They serve delicious noodle with a variety of menus such as with crab, meat (beef), prawn or cuttlefish. The dressing is normally spicy, but you may order less spicy sauce if you like. One can also have takeaway. A popular tourist pit stop for tasting local favorite yellow noodle.", "The Mie Razali noodle from Banda Aceh is very well known in the city.

Although he had had his dinner, he always had enough space for mie Razali. He was simply addicted to the taste of crab noodles, and for him they made it a little less spicy. Perfect. I love normal fried noodles there with shrimps and meat. The people who serve us were very friendly. Sometimes when it was not very crowded they even cameby to us to have a chat. We really love this traditional Acehenese noodle restaurant en we are sooo looking forward to eating there again.", "Only in Heaven are the noodles better! I lived and worked in Banda Aceh for two years after the 2004 Tsunami. Earlier this year I went back for a reunion with old friends and colleagues. I couldn't wait to visit my favourite restaurants again. One that remained a favourite was this one: Mie Razali. There must be a secret ingredient that makes people come back time and again, and that keeps the deliciousness of the noodles alive,even after the passing of several years, in the minds of those who have tasted them. The restaurant is basic, did I say basic? The service is indifferent. The street scene worrying, the heat overwhelming at times of high humidity. But the cuisine is to die for.
